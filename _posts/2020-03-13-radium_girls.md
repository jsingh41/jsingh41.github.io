I don't know how I came across this [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31409135-the-radium-girls), but reading this was the first time I felt, _in the marrow of my bones_, why staying quiet is never really an option.
I don't have notes for this book as I heard it as an audiobook, but this [post](https://www.damninteresting.com/undark-and-the-radium-girls/) does a great job of summarizing the book. Here are the first two paragraphs from the page:

# Excerpt
In 1922, a bank teller named Grace Fryer became concerned when her teeth began to loosen and fall out for no discernible reason. Her troubles were compounded when her jaw became swollen and inflamed, so she sought the assistance of a doctor in diagnosing the inexplicable symptoms. Using a primitive X-ray machine, the physician discovered serious bone decay, the likes of which he had never seen. Her jawbone was honeycombed with small holes, in a random pattern reminiscent of moth-eaten fabric.

As a series of doctors attempted to solve Graceâ€™s mysterious ailment, similar cases began to appear throughout her hometown of New Jersey. One dentist in particular took notice of the unusually high number of deteriorated jawbones among local women, and it took very little investigation to discover a common thread; all of the women had been employed by the same watch-painting factory at one time or another.
