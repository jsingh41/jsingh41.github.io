Foundations
* Introduction
* Deep work: Underappreciated value of intense focus and how professional world’s emphasis on distracting communication tools was holding people back from producing their best work
* The urge to check Twitter or refresh Reddit becomes a nervous twitch that shatters uninterrupted time into shards too small to support the presence necessary for an international life
* Because digital minimalists spend so less time connected that their peers, it’s easy to think of their lifestyle as extreme, but the minimalists would argue that this perception is backward, what’s extreme is how much time everyone else spends staring at their screens.
* Marcus Aurelius: You see how few things you have to do to live a satisfying and reverent life?
* Most importantly, the declutter gives you the space to refine your understanding of the things you value most. 
* Walden, Thoreau: The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. They honestly think there is no choice left. But alert and helathy natures remember that the sun rose clear. It is never too late to give up our prejuidices.
* A lop-sided arms race
* Techonlogy companies encourage behavorial addiction: Intermittent positive reinforcement and the drive for social approval.
* Intermittent positive reinforcement: Slot machine
* Drive for social approval: We’re social beings who can’t ever completely ignore what other people think of us.
* Whatever we’re hoping to see, it never quite meets that bar
* We didn’t sign up for the digital lives we now lead. They were instead, to a large extent, crafted in boardrooms to serve the interests of a select group of technology investors.
* Digital minimalism
* A minimal solution
* Digital minimalism: A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else.
* Minimalists don’t mind missing out on small things; what worries them much more is diminishing the large things they already know for sure make a life good
* Principles of digital minimalism
* #1: Clutter is costly
* Cluttering their time and attention with too many devices creates an overall negative cost that can swamp the small benefits that each individual item provides
* #2: Optimization is important
* Deciding a particular technology supports something they value is only the first step. To truly extract its full potential benefit, it’s necessary to think carefully about how they’ll use the technology.
* #3: Intentionality is satisfying
* Derive significant satisfaction from their general commitment to being more intentional about how they engage with new technologies.
* The digital declutter
* Step#1: Define your Technology Rules
* Step#2: Take a Thirty-Day Break
* Step#3: Reintroduce Technology
* The minimalist technology screen
* Serve something you deeply value, offering some benefit is not enough
* Be the best way to use tehcnology to serve this value (if it’s not, replace it with something better)
* Have a role in your life that is constrained with a standard operating procedure that specified when and how you use it.
* The Value of Solitude
* Solitude Depravation

* Reclaim leisure
* The best and most pleasant life is the life of the intellect
* If your life only consists only of the actions whose worth depends on the existence of problems, difficulties, needs, which these activities aim to solve.
* When you use craft to leave the virtual world of the screen and instead begin to work in more complex ways with the physical world aroudn you, you’re living truer to your primary potential.
* Schedule in advance the time you spend on low-quality leisure.
