The goal of this book is to figure out why do some companies survive even in chaos, where others don’t?
This book studies companies that started from a position of vulnerability, rose to become great companies with spectacular performance, and did so in unstable environments, characterized by big forces, out of their control, fast moving, uncertain, and potentially harmful. Compared to companies that failed to become great in the same extreme environments, using the contract between winners and also-rans.

Studying leaders in an extreme environment to see how the truly great differed from the merely good in environments

Thriving in Uncertainty


Entrenched Myth
Contrary finding
Successful leaders in a turbulent world are bold, risk-seeking visionaries
The best leaders did not have a visionary ability to predict the future. They observed what worked, figured out why it worked, and built upon proven foundations.
Innovation distinguishes 10X companies in a fast-moving, uncertain, and chaotic world
10X companies were not necessarily more innovative than their less successful comparisons
A threat filled world favors the speedy; you’re either the quick or dead
Figure out when to go fast, and when not to
Radical change on the outside requires radical change on the inside
The 10X cases changes less in reaction to their changing world than the comparison cases. Just because your environment is rocked by dramatic change does not mean that you should inflict radical change upon yourself
Great enterprises with 10X success have a lot more good luck
The 10X companies did not generally have more luck than the comparisons


Are you Amundson or Scott?
You don’t wait until you’re in an unexpected storm to discover that you need more strength and endurance.
You prepare with intensity, all the time, so that when conditions turn against you, you can draw from a deep reservoir of strength.




Amundson
Scott
Years of building a foundation for his quest, training his body and learning as much as possible


Build enormous buffers for unforeseen events
Don’t run things dangerously close to calculations
Set guideposts in case you go off target


Presumed bad events might be encountered and prepared for them



People achieve dramatically different outcome snot because they faced dramatically different circumstances, but because of the behaviors displayed.
These people follow three things
Fanatic discipline
Productive Paranoia
Empirical Creativity



Fanatic Discipline
Discipline, in essence, is consistency of action - consistency with values, consistency with long-term goals, consistency with performance standards, consistency of method, consistency over time
They are not just disciplined, they are fanatically disciplined. Their behavior is nowhere near the curve.
Empirical Creativity
Have deep empirical foundations for their decisions and actions, which gave them well-founded confidence and bounded their risk.
Favor empiricism as the foundation for decisive action
Productive Paranoia
They maintain hypervigilance in good times as well as bad. Even in calm, clear, positive conditions, 10Xers constantly consider the possibility that events could turn against them at any moment. 
By embracing the myriad of possible dangers, they prepare themselves in a superior position to overcome danger

Underlying the three core !0Xer behavior is a motivating force: passion, and ambition for a cause or company larger than themselves. 

20 Mile March
Set a performance benchmark to drive consistent progress: Achieve growth no matter what the circumstance
A hurdle that you jump over and a ceiling that you will not rise above, the ambition to achieve and the self-control to hold back.
The 20 Mile March is more than a philosophy. It’s about having concrete, clear, intelligent and rigorously pursued performance mechanisms that keep you on track. The 20 Mile March creates two types of self-imposed discomfort
The discomfort of unwavering commitment to high performance in difficult conditions
The discomfort of holding back in good conditions
Elements of a good 20 mile march
A good 20 mile march uses performance markers that delineate a lower bound of acceptable achievement. These create productive discomfort, much like hard physical training or rigorous mental development, and must be challenging (but not impossible) to achieve in difficult times.
A good 20 Mile March has self-imposed constraints. This creates an upper bound for how far you’ll march when facing robust opportunity and exceptionally good conditions. These constraints should also produce discomfort in the face of pressures and fears that you should be going faster and doing more
A good 20 Mile March is tailored to the enterprise and its environments. There’s no all-purpose 20 Mile March for all enterprises. 
A good 20 Mile March lies largely within your control to achieve. You shouldn’t need luck to achieve your march.
A good 20 Mile March has a Goldilocks time frame, not too short and not too long but just right.
A good 20 Mile March must be achieved with great consistency. Good intentions do not count.

Fire Bullets, then Cannonballs
The 10X companies are not necessarily more innovative than their less successful comparisons. And in some cases, these were less innovative, and just copied the business model straight out
It’s best to be one fad behind, never first to the market, but never last.
Intel delivers is better than intel innovates - because they are able to scale other’s innovations. Intel innovates to a necessary threshold, then blows everyone away with its ability to deliver on its innovations, at expected cost, with high reliability and great consistency.
It is the combination of discipline and creativity that builds it.
What is a bullet?
A bullet is low cost
A bullet is less risky: If it goes awry or hits nothing, the cost isn’t huge
A bullet is less distracting: To the overall organization, but maybe highly engaging for a few people
The 10Xers were much more likely to fire a calibrated cannonball
Productive Paranoia
Build cash reserves and buffers - oxygen canisters - to prepare for unexpected events before they happen
Remain productively paranoid in good times, recognizing that it’s what you do before the storm comes that matters most.
Bound risk - Death line risk, uncontrollable risk and asymmetric risk and manage time based risk
Ask the question, how much time before your risk profile changes? The importance is not to know the answer to the question, the importance is to ask the question
Zoom out, then zoom in - remain hypervigilant to sense changing conditions and respond effectively.
Zoom out: Sense a change in conditions, assess the time horizon in which you will be affected, assess with vigor - Do the new conditions call for disrupting plans? 
Zoom in: Focus on supreme execution of plans
Think first, even when you have to think fast
10Xers distinguish themselves by their ability to define moments that call for changing their plans, changing the focus of their intensity, and/or rearranging their agenda
SMaC recipe
Specific, Methodical and Consistent
A SMaC practice is not the same as a strategy, culture, core values, purpose, or tactics
It tells you what to do and what not to do
