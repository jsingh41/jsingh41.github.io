I chanced upon this [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31922028-women-who-tri) while browsing through the fitness section of the Mountain View Library. I loved every moment of this book.

_“If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl. But whatever you do, you have to keep moving” - Martin King Luther Jr._

# Excerpt
 - I had as many doubts as all of us. Standing at the start line, we are all cowards
 - And then, I do the only thing that was left for me to do. I begin
 - Never underestimate the power of dreams and the influence of human spirit. The potential for greatness lives within all of us.
 - We must be willing to get rid of the life we planned for us so as to have the life that is waiting for us.
 - I believe that every human has a finite number of heartbeats. I don’t intend to waste any of mine doing exercises
 - If God invented marathons to prevent people from doing anything more stupid, the Triathlons must have taken him completely by surprise.
 - Sometimes the road less traveled is less traveled for a reason
 - There are far better things ahead than any we leave behind
 - No road is too long with good company
 - We cannot become what we want to be by remaining who we are
 - We lose ourselves in the things we love. We find ourselves there, too.
 - Squats are a form of torture designed by people who don’t need to do squats in the first place
 - In the hardest moments of a long race, the athlete’s entire conscious experience of reality boils down to a desire to continue pitted against the desire to quit. Nothing else remains.. The desire to continue versus the desire to quit - the athlete is this and this alone until he chooses one or the other. And then the choice is made and he briefly becomes either persevering or quitting until, after he has stopped at the finish line, or God forbid, short of it, the stripped-away layers are piled back on and he becomes his old self again. Only not quite. He is changed, for better, or for worse.
 - Ability is what you’re capable of doing. Motivation determines what you do. Attitude determines how well you do it.
 - Whatever you’re meant to do, do it. The conditions are always impossible.
 - I’m strong; I’m tough; I still wear my eyeliner
 - If there is no struggle, there is no progress
 - Strong women wear their pain like stilettos. No matter how much it hurts, all you see is the beauty of it.
 - Champions are not made on the track or field; champions are made by the things you accomplish and the way you use your abilities in everyday life situations
 - If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together
 - Awards become corroded, friends gather no dust
 - If you only do what you know you can do, you never do very much
 - As we light a path for others, we naturally light our own way
 - There are seven days in a week and someday isn’t one of them
 - Work finally begins when the fear of doing nothing at all trumps the terror of doing it badly
 - The most effective way to do it, is to do it.
 - Running long and hard is an ideal antidepressant, since it’s hard to run and feel sorry for yourself at the same time
 - Pain is temporary, but your finishing time is posted on the Internet forever.
 - That’s the thing about running; your greatest runs are rarely measured by racing success. They are moments in time when running allows you to see how wonderful your life is.
 - You can quit and no one will really care...but you will always know
 - Think of yourself as an athlete. I guarantee you it will change the way you walk, the way you work, and the decisions you make about leadership, teamwork, and success
 - For everything you have missed, you have gained something else, and for everything you gain, you lose something else
 - We all have dreams. But in order to make dreams come into reality, it takes an awful lot of determination, dedication, self-discipline and effort
 - A ship in the harbor is safe. But that’s not ships are built for.
 - Stand up to your obstacles and do something about them. You will find that they haven’t half the strength you think they have
 - What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything?
 - Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one’s courage
 - Here’s what I’m going to tell you about your fear. It’s the most boring thing about you.
 - Courage is like a muscle. We strengthen it with use.
 - I’m always doing things I can’t do. That’s how I get to do them.
 - Stop acting so small. You are the universe in ecstatic motion
 - Life is like a 10-speed. Most of us have gears we never use.
 - Many people shy away from hills. They make it easy on themselves, but that limits their improvement. The more you repeat something, the stronger you get. 
 - The good Lord gave you a body that can stand most anything. It’s your mind you have to convince.
 - It’s when the discomfort strikes that one realizes a strong mind is the most powerful weapon of all
 - Training is what you are doing while your opponent is sleeping in
 - Take care of your body. It’s the only place you have to live.
 - You don’t need to get scared away from endurance sports. You just need to train for endurance the right away.
 - There is no exercise better for the heart than reaching down and lifting people up
 - Anything or anyone that doesn’t bring you alive is too small for you
 - The more difficult the victory, the greater the happiness in winning
 - Strength doesn’t come from physical capacity. It comes from indomitable will
 - Whether you think you can, or can’t, you are right
 - Could, Would, Should, Did
 - You never climb a mountain, get to the top, and say “I should’ve just been content with where I was”
 - A river cuts through the rock, not because of its power, but because of its persistence
 - There are many people praying for the mountains of difficulty to be removed, when what they really need is the courage to climb them
 - It always seems impossible until it’s done
 - You have within you right now everything you will need to deal with whatever the world can throw at you
 - There is no passion to be found in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living

_Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. It is that we are powerful beyond measure._
