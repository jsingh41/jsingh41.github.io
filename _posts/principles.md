Principles are fundamental truths that serve as the foundations for behavior that gets you what you want out of life. They can be applied again and again in simlar situations to help you achieve your goals. Every day, each of us is faced with a blizard of situations we must reposnd to. Without principeles, we would be forced to react to all the things life throws at us indiviudlaly, as if we were experienceing each of them for the first time.
If instead we classify these situations into types and have good principles for dealing with them, we will make better decisions more quickly and have better lives as a result. Having a good set of principles is like having a good collection of recipes for success. All successful people operate by princoples that help them to be successful, though what they choose to be successful at varies enormously, so their principles vary. 
To be principles means to consistently operate with princoples that can be clearly explained. 
Think for yourself to decide
What you want
What is true
What you should do to achieve #1 and #2
… and do that with humility and open-mindedness so that you consider th ebest thinking available to you
I learned my principles over a lifetime of making a lot of mistakes and spending a lot of time reflecting on them. 
Be an independant think who runs after audacious goals
The success lies in knowing how to both strive for a lot and fail well. 
1. Make believably weighted decisions 
Going from I know I’m right to shifting perspectives to “How do I know I’m right”
2. Operate by Principes
That are so clarly laid out that their logic can easily be accessed and you and others can see if you walk to the talk. It is invaluable to reflect on and wroite down your decision-making criteria whenever you make a deicision.
3. Systemize your decision making
Think for yourself
What do you want?
What is true?
What are you going to do about it?
