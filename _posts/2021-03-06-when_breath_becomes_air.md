_What makes life meaningful enough to go on living?_

[When Breath Becomes Air](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25899336-when-breath-becomes-air) by [Paul Kalanithi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kalanithi) is a book about a doctor finding out about his terminal illness stage IV metastatic lung cancer and dealing with it. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live.

About the Author

[Paul Kalanithi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kalanithi) was a neurosurgeon at Stanford and a writer, best known for his book When Breath Becomes Air.


### The Big Ideas



*   What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away?


### Summary



*   I was driven less by achievement than by trying to understand, in earnest: What makes human life meaningful? I still felt literature provided the best account of the life of the mind, while neuroscience laid down the most elegant rules of the brain.
*   Throughout college, my monastic, scholarly study of human meaning would conflict with my urge to forge and strengthen the human relationships that formed that meaning. If the unexamined life was not worth living, was the unlived life worth examining? I could either study meaning or I could experience it.
*   Cadavers reverse the polarity. The mannequins you pretend are real; the cadavers you pretend are fake. But that first day, you just can’t. When I faced my cadaver, slightly blue and bloated, his total deadness and total humanness were undeniable. The knowledge that in four months I would be bisecting this man’s head with a hacksaw seemed unconscionable.
*   The human brain has rendered the organism’s most basic task, reproduction, a treacherous affair. That same brain made things like labor and delivery units, cardiotoco meters, epidurals, and emergency C-sections both possible and necessary.
*   Putting lifestyle first is how you find a job—not a calling.
*   You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving.
*   I began to realize that coming in such close contact with my own mortality had changed both nothing and everything. Before my cancer was diagnosed, I knew that someday I would die, but I didn’t know when. After the diagnosis, I knew that someday I would die, but I didn’t know when. But now I knew it acutely. The problem wasn’t really a scientific one. The fact of death is unsettling. Yet there is no other way to live.
*   I was losing sight of the singular importance of human relationships, not between patients and their families but between doctor and patient. Technical excellence was not enough. As a resident, my highest ideal was not saving lives—everyone dies eventually—but guiding a patient or family to an understanding of death or illness.
*   Years ago, it occurred to me that Darwin and Nietzsche agreed on one thing: the defining characteristic of the organism is striving.
*   The call to protect life—and not merely life but another’s identity; it is perhaps not too much to say another’s soul—was obvious in its sacredness.
*   Shouldn’t terminal illness, then, be the perfect gift to that young man who had wanted to understand death? What better way to understand it than to live it?
*   Science may provide the most useful way to organize empirical, reproducible data, but its power to do so is predicated on its inability to grasp the most central aspects of human life: hope, fear, love, hate, beauty, envy, honor, weakness, striving, suffering, virtue.
*   Human knowledge is never contained in one person. It grows from the relationships we create between each other and the world, and still it is never complete.
*   When you come to one of the many moments in life where you must give an account of yourself, provide a ledger of what you have been, and done, and meant to the world, do not, I pray, discount that you filled a dying man’s days with a sated joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years, a joy that does not hunger for more and more but rests, satisfied. In this time, right now, that is an enormous thing.


### In My Humble Opinion


#### Highlights

This is my third time reading the  book, and it still left me in tears. You can’t put this book down before finishing it. If you are someone like me, single-mindedly trying to focus on the next big goal in life, this book is for you. I had never stopped to question my own mortality, and figure out what really matters in life. Profoundly moving, highly recommended. 


#### Lowlights

Will leave you in tears. You’ve been warned.
