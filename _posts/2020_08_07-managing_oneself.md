What are my Strengths?
Most people don’t really know what they are good at, and what they are not good at. One cannot build performance on weaknesses. Success in the knowledge economy comes to those who know themselves - their strengths, their values, and how they perform. The only way to discover your strengths is through feedback analysis
Concentrate on your strengths. Put yourself where our strengths can produce results.
Work on improving your strengths, and fill gaps in knowledge.
Learn where your intellectual arrogance is causing disabling ignorance and overcome it.
“It is a law of nature that two moving bodies in contact with each other create friction. This is as true for human beings as it is for inanimate objects.”

How do I Perform
It is  a matter of personality. Am I a reader or a listener?
Learn?
Learn by writing, taking copious notes, doing, or talking
Acting on acquired knowledge is key to performance
Not acting condemns one to nonperformance
Learn by talking
Work?
Alone or in a group
Do I produce results as a decision maker or as an adviser? Usually the reason why number two fails when in number one position
Under stress, highly structured, presentable, big or small organization
Do not try to change yourself - you are unlikely to succeed. But work hard to improve the way you perform. 

What are my Values?
Mirror test: What kind of a person do you want to see in the mirror in the morning?
Whether a business should be run for short-term results or with a focus of the long term is a question of values.
A person’s strengths and the way the person performs rarely conflict. Values, in that case, should be the ultimate test. Go for fulfilling roles rather than happy roles

Where do I Belong?
To get to this, you should know: What are your strengths, how do you perform? What are your values?
Successful careers are not planned. They develope when people are prepared for opportunities because they know their strengths, their method of work and values.
