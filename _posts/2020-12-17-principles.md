I remember hearing about the book [Principles](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34536488-principles) during my time at MIT, as it was written by one of the coolest people in Finance, [Ray Dalio] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Dalio). I heard about it again at work, and decided to give it a read. This is one of those book where you can tell in the first couple of pages that the person who wrote this book is a really smart person.  This book is one of those that leave a deep impact no matter what phase of life you're in.

# Excerpt
* Principles are fundamental truths that serve as the foundations for behavior that gets you what you want out of life. They can be applied again and again in similar situations to help you achieve your goals. 
Every day, each of us is faced with a blizzard of situations we must respond to. Without principles, we would be forced to react to all the things life throws at us individually, as if we were experiencing each of them for the first time. If instead, we classify these situations into types and have good principles for dealing with them, we will make better decisions more quickly and have better lives as a result. 

* Having a good set of principles is like having a good collection of recipes for success. All successful people operate by principles that help them to be successful, though what they choose to be successful at varies enormously, so their principles vary. 

* To be principled means to consistently operate with principles that can be clearly explained. 
Think for yourself to decide: What you want, What is true, What you should do to achieve #1 and #2
… and do that with humility and open-mindedness so that you consider the best thinking available to you

* I learned my principles over a lifetime of making a lot of mistakes and spending a lot of time reflecting on them. Be an independent thinker who runs after audacious goals. The success lies in knowing how to both strive for a lot and fail well. 

1. Make believably weighted decisions 
Going from I know I’m right to shifting perspectives to “How do I know I’m right”
2. Operate by Principles
That are so clearly laid out that their logic can easily be accessed and you and others can see if you walk to the talk. It is invaluable to reflect on and write down your decision-making criteria whenever you make a decision.
3. Systemize your decision making
