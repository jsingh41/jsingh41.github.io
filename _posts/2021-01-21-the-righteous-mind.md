## Premise

[The Righteous Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777) by [Jonathan Haidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Haidt) is a book on human human morality. In this book, the author talks about how we divide ourselves into tribes, and how those tribes consist of like-minded people which we use to validate our intuitive predispositions. The author hopes to have given you a new way to think about two of the most important, vexing, and divisive topics in human life: politics and religion, and to find a way for each side to at least understand the other's perspective.

### About the Author

Jonathan Haidt is a social psychologist and professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business. He has written several books on the psychology of morals and emotions, such as [The Happiness Hypothesis](https://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Hypothesis-Finding-Modern-Ancient/dp/0465028020), [The Righteous Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777), [Can't We All Disagree More Constructively?](https://www.amazon.com/Cant-All-Disagree-More-Constructively-ebook/dp/B01KS1HLPC), [The Coddling of the American Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Coddling-American-Mind-Intentions-Generation/dp/0735224919) and [Why Do They Vote That Way?](https://www.amazon.com/Why-They-Vote-That-Way-ebook/dp/B07GVQ3KGD). He is also said to be a part of the [Intellectual Dark Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_dark_web).


## The Big Ideas



*   The human mind is **intrinsically moral**, judgemental and critical, and is **designed to be moral** just the way it is designed to learn language or  music. 
*   Morality is one of the extraordinary human capacities that made civilization possible. Our righteous mind made it possible for humans - and no other animals, to produce large cooperative groups without a glue of kinship, but it also guarantees that **we will always bear the curse of moralistic strife**.
*   Moral intuitions arise **automatically** and almost instantaneously, long **before moral reasoning** has a chance to get started.
*   Social behavior in humans is culturally guided by three ethics -- the ethic of autonomy, the ethic of society, and the ethic of divinity. The Western world follows the ethic of autonomy, whereas most of the ancient civilizations had a combination of all three to varying degrees.
*   Humans have several moral “taste buds”, such as the morality of care, fairness, loyalty, authority, sanctity, etc. People on the left tend to follow the care and fairness values and seem to reject the other three, whereas conservatives tend to follow all five.


## Summary


#### Part I : Intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second



*   The mind is divided, like a rider on an elephant, and the rider’s job is to serve the elephant. The **rider** is our **conscious reasoning**—the stream of words and images of which we are fully aware. The **elephant** is our **subconscious** - the other 99 percent of mental processes. The ones that occur outside of awareness but that actually govern most of our behavior.
*   The author describes two stories and asks readers to judge whether they find it morally wrong
    *   A family’s dog is killed in a car accident in front of their house. They had heard that dog meat is delicious, so they cooked it and ate it for dinner. Noone saw them do it.
    *   A man goes to the store everyday to buy a chicken for dinner. Before cooking the chicken, the man has sex with it. Then he cooks and eats it.


##### Where does morality come from? A case about children

How do children come to understand what’s right and wrong?



*   A **nativist** believes that it comes **from nature** - either through our God-inscribed hearts (as the Bible says), or in our evolved moral emotions.
*   An **empiricist** believes that children are more or less **blank slates at birth**. If morality varies across culture and centuries, how can it be innate?
*   **Rationalism** says that **kids figure out morality for themselves.**


##### Moral development of children



*   [Jean Piaget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Piaget) conducted an [experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_(psychology)) where he proved that **some logical thinking abilities are not innate for children**, such as understanding the conservation of water volume. Additionally, these skills **cannot be learnt** from an adult’s explanation. Kids figure it out for themselves, but only when their minds are ready and they are given the right kinds of experiences.
*   Similarly Jean Piaget’s work on children’s moral abilities indicates that moral abilities are not innate, and they don’t learn it directly from adults. It is rather self-constructed as they play with other kids.
*   We grow into our rationality as a caterpillar grows into a butterfly. If the children get enough experience sharing, taking turns, and playground justice, they will develop their own sense of morality. 
*   [Turiel's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliot_Turiel) (a student of [Kohlberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg)) work showed that children seem to grasp the difference between **social conventions**, which are **arbitrary and changeable** to some extent, and **moral rules**, as related to justice, rights and **welfare of people**. 
*   **Morality is about treating individuals well**. It’s about harm and fairness, and not loyalty, respect, duty, piety, patriotism, or tradition.
*   Hierarchy and authority are generally bad things, so it’s best to let kids figure out for themselves. 
*   It was also evident from the author's other readings that _groups create supernatural beings not to explain the universe but to order their societies. _


##### Meanwhile, in the rest of the world



*   [Shweder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Shweder) explained why the “self” differs so much across cultures: all societies must resolve a small set of questions about how to order society, the most important being how to balance the needs of individuals and groups.
*   Most ancient civilizations have chosen the **sociocentric approach**, placing the needs of groups and institutions first, and subordinating the needs of the individual. 
*   The **individualistic answer** places individuals at the center and makes society a servant of the individual. The individual approach dominated much of the Western world during the enlightenment. 


##### The intuitive dog and its rational tail



*   Western philosophy has been worshipping reason and distrusting the passions for thousands of years. The author calls this worshipful attitude a **rationalist delusion**, because when a group of people make something sacred, the members of the cult lose the ability to think clearly about it. 
*   In 1970, [Steven Pinker](https://stevenpinker.com/), in his book [The Blank Slate](https://www.amazon.com/Blank-Slate-Modern-Denial-Nature/dp/0142003344) describes the ways in which **scientists betrayed the values of science to maintain loyalty to the progressive movement**. Scientists became “moral exhibitionists” in the lecture hall as they demonized fellow scientists and urged their students to evaluate ideas not for their truth but for their consistency with progressive ideals such as racial and gender equality. 
*   [E.O. Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._O._Wilson) believed that there is such a thing called human nature, and most of the rationalists were in reality only generating clever justifications for moral intuitions that were best explained by evolution. 

> Do people believe in human rights because such rights actually exist, like mathematical truths, sitting on a cosmic shelf next to the Pythagorean theorem just waiting to be discovered by Platonic reasoners? Or do people feel revulsion and sympathy when they read accounts of torture, and then invent a story about universal rights to help justify their feelings?


##### Moral dumbfounding experiment



*   The author conducted an experiment in which he and his associate ask people if the following situation was incorrect
    *   “Julie and Mark, who are sister and brother, are traveling together in France. They are both on summer vacation from college. One night they are staying alone in a cabin near the beach. They decide that it would be interesting and fun if they tried making love. At the very least it would be a new experience for each of them. Julie is already taking birth control pills, but Mark uses a condom too, just to be safe. They both enjoy it, but they decide not to do it again. They keep that night as a special secret between them, which makes them feel even closer to each other. So what do you think about this? Was it wrong for them to have sex?”
    *   Only 20% of people said that it was OK to Julie and Mark to have sex.
*   Reasoning was merely the servant of the passions, and when the servant failed to find any good arguments, the master did not change his mind.


##### The rider and the elephant



*   Moral judgement is a cognitive process, as are all forms of judgement. Intuition and reasoning are two different kinds of cognition. Moral emotions are one type of moral intuition, but most moral intuitions are more subtle
*   The elephant are the automatic processes, including emotion, intuition, and all forms of “seeing-that”. Automatic processes work in all animals and humans. We are evolved to run on these automatic processes
*   The riders are the controlled processes, including “reasoning-why”. Reasoning came way later, when humans evolved the capacity for language and reasoning. But the brain did not rewire itself to hand the reins to the reasoning part of the brain. 
*   The rider is good at fabricating post hoc explanations for whatever the elephant has done. 

> Once human beings developed language and began to use it to gossip about each other, it became extremely valuable for elephants to carry around on their backs a full-time public relations firm


#### Part II : There’s more to morality than harm and fairness

The righteous mind is like a tongue with six taste receptors.



*   The author points out that nearly all research in psychology is conducted on a very small subset of the human population: people from cultures that are Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (forming the acronym WEIRD). WEIRD people are statistical outliers; they are the least typical, least representative people you could study if you want to make generalizations about human nature
*   The WEIRDer you are, the more you see a world full of separate objects, rather than relationships.
*   Westerners have a more independent and autonomous concept of the self than East Asians, for eg. When asked, “I am..”, most Americans are likely to list their own psychological characteristics (outgoing, interested in Jazz), whereas East Asians are more likely to list their roles and relationships (a son, a husband, employee of XYZ, etc.)
*   The **ethic of autonomy** is based on the idea that people are, first and foremost, autonomous individuals with wants, needs, and preferences.
*   The **ethic of community** is based on the idea that people are, first and foremost, members of larger entities such as families, teams, armies, companies, tribes, and nations
*   The **ethic of divinity** is based on the idea that people are, first and foremost, temporary vessels within which a divine soul has been implanted
*   I could see beauty in a moral code that emphasized self-control, resistance to temptation, cultivation of one’s higher, nobler self, and negation of the self’s desires
*   Moral matrices bind people together and blind them to the coherence, or even existence, of other matrices. This makes it very difficult for people to consider the possibility that there might really be more than one form of moral truth, or more than one valid framework for judging people or running a society.


##### Taste buds of the righteous mind



*   Similar to how humans have different taste receptors, morality is like a cuisine; it is a cultural construction, influenced by accidents of environment and history, but it’s not so flexible that anything goes.
*   The **care/harm foundation** evolved in response to the adaptive challenge of caring for vulnerable children. It makes us sensitive to signs of suffering and need; it makes us despise cruelty and want to care for those who are suffering.
*   The **fairness/cheating foundation** evolved in response to the adaptive challenge of reaping the rewards of cooperation without getting exploited. It makes us sensitive to indications that another person is likely to be a good (or bad) partner for collaboration and reciprocal altruism.
*   The **loyalty/betrayal foundation** evolved in response to the adaptive challenge of forging relationships that will benefit us within social hierarchies. It makes us sensitive to signs of rank or status, and to signs that other people are (or are not) behaving properly, given their position.
*   The **authority/subversion foundation** evolved initially in response to the adaptive challenge of the omnivore’s dilemma, and then to the broader challenge of living in a world of pathogens and parasites. It includes the behavioral immune system, which can make us wary of a diverse array of symbolic objects and threats. It makes it possible for people to invest objects with irrational and extreme values—both positive and negative—which are important for binding groups together.
*   The **sanctity/degradation foundation** evolved initially in response to the adaptive challenge of the omnivore’s dilemma, and then to the broader challenge of living in a world of pathogens and parasites. It includes the behavioral immune system, which can make us wary of a diverse array of symbolic objects and threats. It makes it possible for people to invest objects with irrational and extreme values—both positive and negative—which are important for binding groups together.

Haidt mentions two more foundations in addition to the five above:



*   The **liberty/oppression foundation** makes people notice and resent any sign of attempted domination. It triggers an urge to band together to resist or overthrow bullies and tyrants. This foundation supports the egalitarianism and antiauthoritarianism of the left, as well as the don’t-tread-on-me and give-me-liberty antigovernment anger of libertarians and some conservatives.
*   The **fairness foundation** focuses more strongly on proportionality. The fairness foundation begins with the psychology of reciprocal altruism, but its duties expanded once humans created gossiping and punitive moral communities. Most people have a deep intuitive concern for the law of karma—they want to see cheaters punished and good citizens rewarded in proportion to their deeds.


##### Left vs. Right



*   It appears that the **Left relies primarily on the Care and Fairness foundations**, whereas the **Right uses all five**.
*   Republicans understand moral psychology. Democrats don’t. Republicans have long understood that the elephant is in charge of political behavior, not the rider, and they know how elephants work.Their slogans, political commercials, and speeches go straight for the gut. Democrats have often aimed their appeals more squarely at the rider, emphasizing specific policies and the benefits they’ll bring to you, the voter. Republicans trigger the full range of intuitions described by Moral Foundations Theory.
*   The moral vision offered by the Democrats since the 1960s, in contrast, seemed narrow, too focused on helping victims and fighting for the rights of the oppressed. The Democrats offered just sugar (Care) and salt (Fairness as equality), whereas Republican morality appealed to all five taste receptors.


##### Measuring Morals



*   Based on a questionnaire, it turns out that everyone - left, right, and center—says that concerns about compassion, cruelty, fairness, and injustice are relevant to their judgments about right and wrong. Yet still, the lines slope downward. Liberals say that these issues are a bit more relevant to morality than do conservatives.
*   But when we look at the Loyalty, Authority, and Sanctity foundations, the story is quite different. **Liberals largely reject these considerations**. They show such a large gap between these foundations versus the Care and Fairness foundations that we might say, as shorthand, that liberals have a two-foundation morality.


## In My Humble Opinion

This is one of the most useful books I’ve read so far in my quest to understand why people believe what they believe, and act the way they do. In late-2020, I had the chance to spend time with an interesting, albeit radical group of liberal folks. Some of their conversations and behavior spurred an almost instantaneous, visceral reaction within me, and no amount of rationalization, or my desire to agree with them could get me to change my mind.  In their quest to show me the thrills of their free-spirited life, I was able to see the beauty in a moral code that emphasized self-control, resistance to temptation, cultivation of one’s higher, nobler self, and negation of the self’s desires. I happened to come across this book at around the same time, and it helped me understand why I felt the way I felt. For that, I will be eternally thankful to Jonathan Haidt. 

The book is guaranteed to make you sharper and softer and more empathetic towards the other side. In today’s divisive world, where both sides judge the other side on their worst behavior, we all could use a little bit of empathy. 


### Highlights

It takes a genius to do justice to both sides, to step out of the moral matrix and see things from the other perspective, and describe them in clinical yet empathetic words. Jonathan Haidt does just that. I love how unbiased the book is, and does justice to both sides without insulting or belittling the beliefs of any side. 

I am also a huge fan of the imagery - the rider and the elephant, the moral taste buds, and stepping out of the moral matrix. Haidt’s book is both soft and audacious. It holds ideas that aim to challenge many readers, particularly liberals. 

I think everyone in California should read this book. 


### Lowlights

The book suffers from the same dilemma that I find myself in a lot of times -- It understands and emphasizes both sides, but fails to provide concrete solutions. I wouldn’t hold it too much against the book though -- The book is meant to spur conversations, which it does brilliantly. As such, there aren’t a lot of things I would change about the book.


## What Can You Do



*   Reach out to people and try and understand them as human beings than labeling someone as a “conservative” or “liberal” and using that label as an excuse to invalidate them
*   Appeal to the person’s “elephant” instead of the “rider”, and also try and understand their moral values 
*   Empathize more, rationalize less.



## Reading Tips

I strongly recommend this book. Irrespective of where you stand politically, you will learn something about the human mind that you didn’t know before. If you’re short on time, just read the Part-2 of the book, or check out the [Ted talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SOQduoLgRw&ab_channel=TED-Ed). 

I hope you feel as delighted as I was when I first read the book.
