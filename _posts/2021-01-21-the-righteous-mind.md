## Premise

[The Righteous Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777) by [Jonathan Haidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Haidt) is a book on human morality. The book talks about how we divide ourselves into tribes and those tribes consist of like-minded people which we use to validate our intuitive predispositions. The author hopes to have given you a new way to think about two of the most important, vexing, and divisive topics in human life: politics and religion, and to find a way for each side to at least understand the other's perspective.

## The Big Ideas



*   The human mind is **intrinsically moral**, moralistic, judgemental and critical, and is **designed to be moral** just the way it is designed to learn language or  music. 
*   Morality is one of the extraordinary human capacities that made civilization possible, and our complex moral psychology has helped us burst out from being hunter-gatherers into the delights, comforts and peacefulness of modern society. Our righteous mind made it possible for humans - and no other animals, to produce large cooperative groups without a glue of kinship, but it also guarantees that **we will always bear the curse of moralistic strife**.
*   Moral intuitions arise **automatically** and almost instantaneously, long **before moral reasoning** has a chance to get started.

## Summary


#### Part I : Intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second



*   The mind is divided, like a rider on an elephant, and the rider’s job is to serve the elephant. The **rider** is our **conscious reasoning—the** stream of words and images of which we are fully aware. The **elephant** is our **subconscious** - the other 99 percent of mental processes. The ones that occur outside of awareness but that actually govern most of our behavior
*   The author describes two stories and asks readers to judge whether they find it morally wrong
    *   A family’s dog is killed in a car accident in front of their house. They had heard that dog meat is delicious, so they cooked it and ate it for dinner. Noone saw them do it.
    *   A man goes to the store everyday to buy a chicken for dinner. Before cooking the chicken, the man has sex with it. Then he cooks and eats it.


##### Where does morality come from? A case about children

How do children come to understand what’s right and wrong?



*   A **nativist** believes that it comes **from nature** - either through our God-inscribed hearts (as the Bible says), or in our evolved moral emotions.
*   An **empiricist** believes that children are more or less **blank slates at birth**. If morality varies across culture and centuries, how can it be innate?
*   **Rationalism** says that **kids figure out morality for themselves.**


##### Moral development of children



*   [Jean Piaget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Piaget) conducted an [experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_(psychology)) where he proved that **some logical thinking abilities are not innate for children**, such as understanding the conservation of water volume. Additionally, these skills **cannot be learnt** from an adult’s explanation. Kids figure it out for themselves, but only when their minds are ready and they are given the right kinds of experiences.
*   Similarly Jean Piaget’s work on children’s moral abilities indicates that moral abilities are not innate, and they don’t learn it directly from adults. It is rather self-constructed as they play with other kids.
*   We grow into our rationality as a caterpillar grows into a butterfly. If the children get enough experience sharing, taking turns, and playground justice, they will develop their own sense of morality. 
*   [Turiel's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliot_Turiel) (a student of [Kohlberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg)) work showed that children seem to grasp the difference between **social conventions**, which are **arbitrary and changeable** to some extent, and **moral rules**, as related to justice, rights and **welfare of people**. 
*   **Morality is about treating individuals well**. It’s about harm and fairness, and not loyalty, respect, duty, piety, patriotism, or tradition.
*   Hierarchy and authority are generally bad things, so it’s best to let kids figure out for themselves. 
*   It was also evident from the author's other readings that _groups create supernatural beings not to explain the universe but to order their societies. _


##### Meanwhile, in the rest of the world



*   [Shweder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Shweder) explained why the “self” differs so much across cultures: all societies must resolve a small set of questions about how to order society, the most important being how to balance the needs of individuals and groups.
*   Most ancient civilizations have chosen the **sociocentric approach**, placing the needs of groups and institutions first, and subordinating the needs of the individual. 
*   The **individualistic answer** places individuals at the center and makes society a servant of the individual. The individual approach dominated much of the Western world during the enlightenment. 


##### In summary



*   The moral domain varies by culture. It is unusually narrow in Western, educated, and individualistic cultures. Sociocentric cultures broaden the moral domain to encompass and regulate more aspects of life.
*   People sometimes have gut feelings—particularly about disgust and disrespect—that can drive their reasoning. Moral reasoning is sometimes a post hoc fabrication.
*   Morality can’t be entirely self-constructed by children based on their growing understanding of harm. Cultural learning or guidance must play a larger role than rationalist theories had given it.


##### The intuitive dog and its rational tail



*   Western philosophy has been worshipping reason and distrusting the passions for thousands of years. The author calls this worshipful attitude a rationalist delusion, because when a group of people make something sacred, the members of the cult lose the ability to think clearly about it. 
*   There were two waves of moralism that turned nativism into a moral offense. 
    *   Social Darwinism: The idea that the richest and the most successful nations, races and individuals are the fittest. Therefore, giving charity to the poor interferes with the natural progress of evolution: it allows the poor to breed
    *   The radical reformers of the 1970s that believed that human nature is a blank slate on which any utopian vision can be sketched.
*   In 1970, [Steven Pinker](https://stevenpinker.com/), in his book [The Blank Slate](https://www.amazon.com/Blank-Slate-Modern-Denial-Nature/dp/0142003344), Pinker describes the ways **scientists betrayed the values of science to maintain loyalty to the progressive movement**. Scientists became “moral exhibitionists” in the lecture hall as they demonized fellow scientists and urged their students to evaluate ideas not for their truth but for their consistency with progressive ideals such as racial and gender equality. 
*   [E.O. Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._O._Wilson) believed that there is such a thing called human nature, and most of the rationalists were in reality only generating clever justifications for moral intuitions that were best explained by evolution. 
*   “Do people believe in human rights because such rights actually exist, like mathematical truths, sitting on a cosmic shelf next to the Pythagorean theorem just waiting to be discovered by Platonic reasoners? Or do people feel revulsion and sympathy when they read accounts of torture, and then invent a story about universal rights to help justify their feelings?
*   Gut feelings and bodily reactions were necessary to think rationally


##### Moral dumbfounding experiment



*   The author conducted an experiment in which he and his associate ask people if the following situation was incorrect
    *   “Julie and Mark, who are sister and brother, are traveling together in France. They are both on summer vacation from college. One night they are staying alone in a cabin near the beach. They decide that it would be interesting and fun if they tried making love. At the very least it would be a new experience for each of them. Julie is already taking birth control pills, but Mark uses a condom too, just to be safe. They both enjoy it, but they decide not to do it again. They keep that night as a special secret between them, which makes them feel even closer to each other. So what do you think about this? Was it wrong for them to have sex?”
    *   Only 20% of people said that it was OK to Julie and Mark to have sex.
*   Reasoning was merely the servant of the passions, and when the servant failed to find any good arguments, the master did not change his mind.


##### The rider and the elephant



*   Moral judgement is a cognitive process, as are all forms of judgement. Intuition and reasoning are two different kinds of cognition. Moral emotions are one type of moral intuition, but most moral intuitions are more subtle
*   The elephant are the automatic processes, including emotion, intuition, and all forms of “seeing-that”. Automatic processes work in all animals and humans. We are evolved to run on these automatic processes
*   The riders are the controlled processes, including “reasoning-why”. Reasoning came way later, when humans evolved the capacity for language and reasoning. But the brain did not rewire itself to hand the reins to the reasoning part of the brain. 
*   The rider is good at fabricating post hoc explanations for whatever the elephant has done. 

_Once human beings developed language and began to use it to gossip about each other, it became extremely valuable for elephants to carry around on their backs a full-time public relations firm



*   If you want to change people’s minds, you have to talk to their elephants. Dale Carnegie, in his book How to Win Friends and Influence People also urges people to avoid direct confrontations. Insead, he advises people to begin in a friendly way, be a good listener, and never say “you’re wrong”. 
*   But very often, when it comes to moral and political arguments, our righteous minds shift into combat mode, and even though it may impress our allies, it does little to convince the other side.


#### Part II : There’s more to morality than harm and fairness

The righteous mind is like a tongue with six taste receptors. More coming soon..
