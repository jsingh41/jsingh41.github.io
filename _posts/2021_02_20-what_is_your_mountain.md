> Mountains are not stadiums where I satisfy my ambition to achieve, they are the cathedrals where I practice my religion…I go to them as humans go to worship. From their lofty summits I view my past, dream of the future and, with an unusual acuity, am allowed to experience the present moment…my vision cleared, my strength renewed. In the mountains I celebrate creation. On each journey I am reborn.


2 years ago, I took a trip that changed me, and I am here to talk about it.

In October of 2018,.  I hiked Mt. Whitney, which, at 14505 feet, is the tallest mountain in the lower 48 states of America. We summited Mt. Whitney in a day, gaining over 6800’, that is more than 1 vertical mile, walking over 26 miles, the length of a marathon. 16 hours, 60,000 steps is what it took me to do that. What that mountain gave back to me is something I cannot quantify.

I’ve never been a very active person in my life. I was of the opinion that you are born with a finite number of heartbeats, and I didn’t want to waste mine on exercise. For me, no pain, no gain was not a motto. It was a multiple choice question and I always picked No Pain.

Somehow, my crazy friends convinced me to try hiking, and lo and behold, a few months later,  I found myself on the trailhead, at 2 am. I thought about what I usually do at 2am, my favorite activity of all time, sleeping comfortably, snuggled in my warm comforter. And here I was, in freezing temperature, wearing three jackets and two pants, with hiking poles in hand, a headlamp strapped to my forehead, and a 20 pound backpack on my shoulders. Oh, I missed my comforter. At this moment, I also realized, I have become one of those crazy people, but secretly, I was excited. Never in my life had I been so sleepy, and so awake at the same time. 

We made our way through the marked trail in the forest, the two of us, silently walking, with a stream of river somewhere in the distance, and the rustle of the leaves that we were stepping on. Not a word was spoken, we just wanted to embrace the silence of the full moon night.

As soon as we went above the treeline, we found ourselves surrounded  by gray granite peaks, bathing in the moonlight, with stars twinkling behind them. Below us, we could see a trail of headlamps, trying to make their way up. From that elevation, they looked like some very disciplined and dedicated fireflies. Standing there makes you realize that we are all just a bunch of tiny, mortal human beings trying to get atop a huge mountain that has been there way before any of us, and will continue to be there, long after we are gone. We cannot conquer them, we can only rise to their height for a short time; and for that they demand a great deal. The moonlight, away from the city, shone so bright that we didn’t need our headlamps.  I felt like I was in a painting. Either that, or I was high.

As the sun began to rise we found ourselves front and center to one of the most spectacular sunrises I have ever seen. I've seen the sun rising over mountain peaks from down below many times, but to see Mount Whitney and each of its striking needles light up one by one, in a pink and red glow... it was surreal. It woke me up like no coffee ever has. 

All of us spent around 30 minutes just taking it all in. In front of us, was the moon, almost about to set, as if it didn't want to say goodbye. And towards our back, there was the sun just getting out of bed over the horizon. And the stars that covered the sky in between was all that we needed to hold this image forever. It almost made us forget that there was a 1,500-foot drop 2 feet from where we were standing.

With every step, I felt like time had slowed down, and felt all of my life’s problems had started to dissolve. I wasn’t thinking about my next promotion, my next presentation - None of that mattered. All it mattered was the rise and fall of my breath and my next step. That’s it.

As we rose above 13000 ft, every breath started getting more difficult, every step felt heavier, but we persevered. This person who’d never run a mile till a few months ago, she persevered. I felt like I had within me that I needed to deal with whatever the world wanted to throw at me. 

We pushed and pushed and finally made it to the top of the mountain at 11am. Getting to the top of Sierra Nevadas was like being on top of a cathedral, with everything stretching out beneath you for miles and miles. This is my temple. This is my religion. I felt so proud of myself, yet so humbled by the mountain. I felt overwhelmed with emotion, yet completely drained and empty in a peaceful way. I was just so grateful to be there, to experience the views that I had earned.

And that is when I realized that for me, being up on the mountains - hiking, camping, snowshoeing are the things I lose myself in. And I believe that each one of us has a mountain in their lives. The thing where you lose yourself, and you find yourself. The thing that brings out the human in you. the soul in you. the love in you. 

It may look really tall, and really far, and really difficult. It may have long stretches of boring flat, or rocky boulders to get around, but in the end, it will all be worth it.

You never climb a mountain, get to the top, and say “I should’ve just been content with where I was”.  The struggle is not with the enemy, or a competitor, but with yourself. 

So, what is your mountain?
