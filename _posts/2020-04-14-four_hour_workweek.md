I read this [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/368593.The_4_Hour_Workweek) in my phase of going for "productivity hacks". Some aspects of the book are douchey, but if you eliminate the noise, there are a few advice that a reader can take to live a better life. 

# Excerpt

The idea is not to have a million dollars in the bank account. It is to have the kind of lifestyle that we think a million dollars can give you.

Things you can do:

*   Have others work for you, rather you work for yourself
*   Distribute periods of work and recovery/adventure throughout. The goal is not inactivity. Doing what you are passionate about is the goal.
*   To do all the things you want to do, and to be all the things you want to be, not to buy all the things that you want to buy
*   To be neither the boss nor the employee, but to be the owner. To own the trains and let someone else run the schedule, rather than to decide between being an employee or a boss
*   To make a ton of money with specific dreams to chase and defined goals with steps and timelines included, rather than just to make a ton of money. What are you working for?
*   To have more quality and less clutter. Are you contributing something to this world, or just banging on a keyboard, shuffling papers, and coming home to a drunken existence over the weekend?
*   To have the freedom and resolve to pursue what you want to do without reverting to working for work’s sake. It is okay to dig deep to find your passions or to revive your hobbies that have been atrophied to near extinction. The goal is not just to eliminate the bad, which will only leave a vacuum, but to fill it with all the best things that you can find.
*   Money is multiplied depending on how much you can control: what you do, when you do, how you do
*   Don’t fix it until it is broken - but realize quick if things are broken
*   Everything popular is wrong
