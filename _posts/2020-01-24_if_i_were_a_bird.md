If I were a bird, then I'd be free
Free to leave this misery
Now that I know that you're around
I'll slip away without a sound

Silence sits within my soul
Nothing left, nothing left to make me whole
To try again and start anew
To break the chains to get me through

And as the rain begins to fall
Casting shadows on the wall
I close my eyes and dare the thunder
To break the spell that I've been under

Escape a world that cannot see
That all that's empty lies in me
To try again and start anew
And make the change to help me through

Makes me want to fly away
No reasons left to make me stay
To quit before I even start
To leave this darkness in my heart

I did not write this, but have known this poem for more than 10 years now. I don't know the origin of this poem.
Update: Ah, Digimon.
