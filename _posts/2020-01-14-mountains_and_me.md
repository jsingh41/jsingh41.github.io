In October last year, I took a trip that changed me. Now I’m not one of those people who have life changing events every two-three months, but this one was special. Because that trip changed the way I think about what matters in life, what is important in my life. 

I hiked Mt. Whitney, the tallest mountain in the lower 48 states in the fall of 2018. We summited Mt. Whitney in a day, gaining over 6800’ over 26 miles. That is more than 1 mile of vertical elevation gain over a marathon's distance. I gave it 16 unwavering hours, 60000 steps, all of my energy, perseverance, mental strength and leg strength. What that mountain gave back to me is something I cannot quantify.

I have never been a very active person in my life. I was of the opinion that you are born with a finite number of heartbeats, and I didn’t want to waste mine on exercise. For me "No Pain, No Gain" was not a motto, it was a multiple choice question and I always picked **No Pain** :P

But as life happened, I realized that there is more to the bay area than the bursting tech scene, meetups and talking about the next big IPO. California is *fucking* beautiful. 

We hit the trailhead at around 2am. I thought about what I usually do at 2am --  sleeping comfortably, snuggled in my warm comforter. And here I was , in near freezing temperature, wearing three jackets, two pants, hiking poles in hand, and a headlamp strapped to my forehead. 

Fortunately for us, it was a full moon night. You don’t really the beauty of the full moon and starry night unless you are in a place with no city lights. So here I was, at 3am, in the middle of nowhere, the moon was shining in all its glory, with mountains surrounding us from all sides. As soon as we went above tree-line, I could see the granite peaks bathing in the moonlight. We could see a trail of headlamps below us making their way up. Taking in that scene makes you realize that we are all just a bunch of tiny, mortal human beings trying to get atop a mountain that has been there way longer than any of us, and will be there, way after any of us. 

As the sun began to rise, I found myself in one of the most spectacular sunrises I have ever seen. This energized me like no coffee ever has. I have seen sunrises over mountain peaks from far below, but I had never witness an alpenglow before this trip. All of us spent around 30 minutes just taking it all in. In front of us, was the moon, almost about to set, as if it didn’t want to say goodbye. And towards our back, there was the sun just getting out of bed. And the stars that covered the sky in between was just what we needed to hold this image forever. 

Getting to the top of Sierra Nevadas was like being on top of a cathedral. This is my temple. This is my religion. And for me, being up on the mountains - hiking, snowshoeing, or camping are the things I lose myself in. Interestingly, this is where I find myself as well. 

You have to find that place that brings out the human in you, the soul in you, the love in you.

> Because in the end, you won’t remember the time you spent working in the office or mowing your lawn. Climb that goddamn mountain.

So, what is your mountain?
