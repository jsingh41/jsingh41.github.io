Paradox of Choice by Barry Schwartz, is a book about how the abundance of choice available to us today is more detrimental to our well being than liberating. We think more choice equals more freedom and more satisfaction, but is that really the case?

In this book, the author begins by describing the current problem of having too many choices, and how this has come to be the norm. Instead of being fetishistic in demanding our right to choices, one must consider whether having an abundance of choice nourishes us or deprives us. The premise of the book is that the fact that some choice is good doesn’t necessarily mean that more choice is better. Does the benefits of having an overload of choice outweigh the cost that comes with it? 


## Part I : When We Choose 

Many years ago, the distinguished political philosopher Isaiah Berlin made an important distinction between "negative liberty" and "positive liberty." Negative liberty is "freedom from"—freedom from constraint, freedom from being told what to do by others. Positive liberty is "freedom to"—the availability of opportunities to be the author of your life and to make it meaningful and significant.

Would we be better off if we embraced certain voluntary constraints on our freedom of choice, instead of rebelling against it? We would be better off seeking what is good enough instead of seeking the best . Lowering your expectation about the result of the decision The number 1 reason for sadness is hope. We would be better off if some of the decisions we made were non-reversible.

Is sifting through 50 different varieties of sunglasses really a good use of my time? Knowing that I could have this, but also that? It means that decisions require more effort, it makes mistakes more likely, and the psychological consequences of mistakes more severe.


## Part II : How We Choose

Most decision making will involve these steps:



*   Figure out your goals or set of goals related to your objective - What do you really want? Evaluate the importance of each goal 
*   Array the options 
*   Evaluate how likely each of the option is to meet your goals

An interesting aspect of experiences is that experiences are not an area under the curve of the time you were experiencing it - how you rate a positive or negative experience is usually determined by how good they feel at their best, and how good they feel at the end. So, in retrospect, you might remember a one-week vacation that had some great moments and finished with a bang as more pleasurable than a four week long one. Seems like neither our predictions of how we will feel after an experience nor our memories of how we did feel during the experience are very accurate reflections of how we actually do feel while the experience is occurring.


### Maximizers vs. Satisficers

 Maximizers engage in more product comparisons than satisficers, both before and after they make purchasing decisions. Maximizers take longer than satisficers to decide on a purchase. Maximizers spend more time than satisficers comparing their purchasing decisions to decisions of others. They are more likely to experience regret after a purchase, spend time thinking about hypothetical alternatives to the purchase they’ve made, and less positive about their decisions. An important question that the author raises is this: Does choice create maximizers?


## Part III : Why We Suffer 

200 years ago, Adam Smith observed that individual freedom of choice ensures the most efficient production and distribution of society’s goods.

But as important as the instrumental value of choice maye be, choice reflects another value that might be even more important. Freedom to choose has expressive value - Choice is what enables us to tell the world who we are and what we care about. Every choice we make is a testament to our autonomy, and to our self-determination. We express ourselves, either consciously or subconsciously in the clothes we wear, food we eat, hobbies we pursue - each of these choices have an expressive function, rather than a practical aspect.

Animals learn that being exposed to inescapable shocks that nothing they did made a difference, they were helpless in controlling their own fate - learned helplessness. We can learn that we don’t have control over a few things. Learned helplessness can affect future motivation to try. It can detect future ability to detect that you have control over a few situations. It can lead to clinical depression. Our most fundamental sense of well being depends on our having the ability to exert control over our environment and recognizing that we do. In the context of discussing choice and autonomy, it is interesting to note that in many ways, social ties actually decrease freedom, choice and autonomy. Marriage is commitment to a particular person that curtails freedom of sexual and emotional partners. And serious friendship imposes a lasting hold on you. 


## Part IV : What we Can Do

Freedom or commitment? Second order decisions Rules 

A concept that you live by and follow and never break under any circumstances. Always putting on a seat belt, not cheating on your partner. Following rules eliminates troublesome choices in your life. Having the discipline to live by the rules you make for yourself is another matter of course. Presumptions are like the default setting that are always in action and are present by default unless you change it. Like brushing your teeth every morning. 

Standards are less rigorous, but when we establish a standard, we are essentially dividing the world of options into two categories: options that meet the standard and options that don’t. More like satisfaction than maximizing. Deciding that once we find something that meets our standards, we'll stick with it essentially takes away that area of decision making. Eg: Friendships. We are drawn to people who meet our standards (intelligence, kindness, character, loyalty, wit), and then we stick to them.
