> _Knowing what’s good enough requires knowing yourself and what you care about. What we don’t realize is that the very option of being allowed to change our minds seems to increase the chances that we will change our minds._


## Premise

[Paradox of Choice](https://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Choice-Why-More-Less/dp/149151423X) by [Barry Schwartz](https://www.swarthmore.edu/profile/barry-schwartz) is a book about how the abundance of choice available to us today is more detrimental to our well being than liberating. We think more choice equals more freedom and more satisfaction. But in reality, it can prevent us from making meaningful progress in our lives, leaving us emotionally unsatisfied and always yearning for more. Instead of being fetishistic in demanding our right to choices, one must consider whether having an abundance of choice nourishes us or deprives us.


## About the author

[Barry Schwartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Schwartz_(psychologist)) is a professor of social theory and social action at Swarthmore College. He has written 8 books as of 2020 on psychology and economics. 


## The Big Ideas



*   The premise of the book is that some choice is good doesn’t necessarily mean that more choice is better. Contrary to popular belief, people tend to be happier when they have fewer choices.
*   **Maximizers** are people who seek the best possible option when asked to make a choice. Maximizers always second guess their choices, wondering if they passed on a better option, and are generally anxious and miserable about their choices.
*   **Satisficers** are people who figure out what are the basic requirements that they want fulfilled, and seek whatever is good enough. **It is better to be a satisficer than a maximizer** as satisficers are happier people.
*   Sometimes, it would be better off to accept certain voluntary constraints on our freedom of choice for long-term happiness. **We would be better off if some choices that we make are irreversible**. Knowing that you’ve made a choice that you will not reverse allows you to pour your energy into improving the relationship that you have rather than constantly second-guessing it.
*   **When in doubt, leave it to the experts. **


## Summary


#### Part I : When We Choose 

There is an important distinction between "negative liberty" and "positive liberty". **Negative liberty is "freedom from"**—freedom from constraints, freedom from being told what to do by others. **Positive liberty is "freedom to"**—the availability of opportunities to be the author of your life and to make it meaningful and significant.

Is sifting through 50 different varieties of sunglasses really a good use of my time? Knowing that I could have this, but also that? It means that decisions require more effort, it makes mistakes more likely, and the psychological consequences of mistakes more severe.

Would we be better off if we embraced certain voluntary constraints on our freedom of choice, instead of rebelling against it? Perhaps. We would be better off seeking what is good enough instead of seeking the best . The number 1 reason for sadness is hope. We would be better off if some of the decisions we made were irreversible.

Part II : How We Choose

Most decision making will involve these steps:



*   Figure out your goals or set of goals related to your objective - What do you really want? Evaluate the importance of each goal 
*   Array the options 
*   Evaluate how likely each of the option is to meet your goals

Maximizers vs. Satisficers

Maximizers engage in more product comparisons than satisficers, both before and after they make purchasing decisions. Maximizers take longer than satisficers to decide on a purchase. Maximizers spend more time than satisficers comparing their purchasing decisions to decisions of others. They are more likely to experience regret after a purchase, spend time thinking about hypothetical alternatives to the purchase they’ve made, and less positive about their decisions. An important question that the author raises is: Does choice create maximizers?

Part III : Why We Suffer 

Freedom to choose has expressive value - Choice is what enables us to tell the world who we are and what we care about. **Every choice we make is a testament** to our autonomy, and to our self-determination. We express ourselves, either consciously or subconsciously in the clothes we wear, food we eat, hobbies we pursue - each of these choices have an expressive function, rather than a practical aspect.

Animals learn that being exposed to inescapable shocks that nothing they did made a difference, they were helpless in controlling their own fate - learned helplessness. We can learn that we don’t have control over a few things. **Learned helplessness can affect our future motivation to try**. Our most fundamental sense of well being depends on our having the ability to exert control over our environment and recognizing that we do. 

In the context of discussing choice and autonomy, it is interesting to note that in many ways, **social ties actually decrease freedom, choice and autonomy**. Marriage is commitment to a particular person that curtails freedom of sexual and emotional partners. And serious friendship imposes a lasting hold on you. In spite of this, it is sometimes helpful to accept a reduction in available choices to maximize long term benefits of committing to an endeavor and sticking to it. Think long term investments, for example.

Part IV : What We Can Do

**Commit to irreversible decisions**. A concept that you live by and follow and never break under any circumstances. Always putting on a seat belt, not cheating on your partner. **Following rules eliminates troublesome choices in your life**. Having the discipline to live by the rules you make for yourself is the mark of a conscientious  person. 

Standards are less rigorous, but when we establish a standard, we are essentially dividing the world of options into two categories: options that meet the standard and options that don’t. More like satisfaction than maximizing. Deciding that once we find something that meets our standards, we'll stick with it essentially takes away that area of decision making. Eg: Friendships. We are drawn to people who meet our standards (intelligence, kindness, character, loyalty, wit), and then we stick to them.


## In My Humble Opinion


### Highlights

The Paradox of Choice talks about a concept that we all have felt at some point of time, and does an amazing job of verbalizing our feelings. Whether it is about making a choice about the clothes we wear, where to spend our time, or in romantic situations, reading this book will be a game changer.


### Lowlights

I had a great time reading this book, and as such I couldn’t find anything to critique. It would be great to see more research done in this area so there is concrete evidence for some of the things that Schwartz claims anecdotally.


## What Can You Do



*   Choose when to choose. Know what is important in your life, and only spend your cognitive efforts on those decisions. For the rest, good enough would do.
*   Satisfice more and maximize less
*   Make your decisions irreversible and then stick to it. Studies show that people who know they cannot reverse their decisions are happier with them.
*   Be grateful for the things you have. Each day, set aside some time to appreciate all the wonderful things and wonderful people you have in life. 
*   Don’t indulge in social comparisons. 


## Related Books

I found Richard Thaler’s book Misbehaving along similar lines, although that seemed much more thorough, and more researched than anecdotal than this book. Although this book leans towards psychology, I find similar themes in minimalism, like Marie Kondo’s The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up, and the subtle art of not giving a fuck. The less distractions you have in life, and the less f*cks you give, or give to the things that really, really matter, you would be much happier in life.


## Reading Tips

This book had a lot of new concepts - such as satisficers vs. maximizers, but can be easily listened to in an audiobook format as well. I didn’t find it so dense that it would require multiple reads. If you’re already familiar with cognitive biases, feel free to skip those sections while reading the book. It is mostly a summary of concepts mentioned in other wonderful books, so you don’t need to delve deep here.
