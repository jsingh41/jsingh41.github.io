Paradox of Choice is a book, by Barry Schwartz as the name suggests, is a book about how the abundance of choice available to us today is more detrimental to our well being than liberating. We think  more choice equals more freedom, and more satisfaction, but is that really the case?
This book draws closely with the others in its genre, Thinking Fast and Slow, Predictably Irrational (or whatever that book was). This book draws heavily from Thinking Fast and Slow (more about it below) These books look into the psychology of why people behave the way they do, and if the direction in which the world is heading right now is to maximize for human happiness and productivity, or whose agenda are we trying to push here?
In this book, the author beings by describing the current problem of having too many choices, and how this has come to be hte norm. Instead of being fetishitic in demand our right to choices, one must consider whether having an abundance of choice nourishes us or deprives us.
The premise of the book is that the fact that some choice is good doesn’t necessarily translate to mean that more choice is better. Does the benefits of having an overload of choice outweigh the cost that comes with it? It enables us to control our destinies and to come close to getting exactly what we want out of any situation.
We make the best use of our freedom by learning to make good choices about the things that matter?

When We Choose
Many years ago, the distinguished political philosopher Isaiah Berlin made an important distinction between "negative liberty" and "positive liberty." Negative liberty is "freedom from"—freedom from constraint, freedom from being told what to do by others. Posi-tive liberty is "freedom to"—the availability of opportunities to be the author of your life and to make it meaningful and significant.

Would we be better off if we embraced certain voluntary constraints on our freedom of choice, instead of rebelling against it
We would be better off seeking what is good enough instead of seeking the best
Lowering your expectation about the result of the decision
The #1 reason of sadness is hope
Would be better off if the decisions we made were non-reversible

What is extraneous information to you?
Is sifting through 50 different varieties of sunglasses really a good use of my time? Knowing that I could have this, but also that?
It means that decisions require more effort, it makes mistakes more likely, and the psychological consequences of mistaks more severe.

How We Choose

Most decision making will involve these steps
Figure out your goals or set of goals related to your objective - What do you really want?
Evaluate the importance of each goal
Array the otpions
Evaluate how likely each of the optiosn is to meet your goals

An interesting aspect of experiences is that experiences are not an area under the curve of the time you were experiencing it - how you rate a positive or negative experience is usually determined by how good they feel at their best, and how good they feel at the end. So, in retrospect, you might remember a one-week vacation that had some great moments and finished with a bang as more pleasurable than a four week long one. Seems like the neither our predictions of how we will feel after an experience nor our memories of how we did feel during the experience are very accurate reflections of how we actually do feel while the experience is occurring.

From Thinking Fast and Slow
The availability heurestic: Giving undue weight to some types of information in contrast to others. The more available some piece of information is to memory, the more frequenctly we must have encountered in the past. Not just the frequency, salience or vividness matters as well. Eg: Vivid interviews with people. People’s natural egocentrism makes it much easier to bring their own actions to mind than those of their partner.
Anchoring - We never evaluate anything in absolute terms, we always evaluate things at the mercy of the context in which it is found. We tend to look for benchmarks from the immediate surrounding
Framing - In what context is the decision framed?
WE also prefer a mall, sure gain to a larger uncertain one. When it comes to losses, we will risk a large loss to avoid a smaller one.

Maximizers vs. Satisficers
Maximizers engage in more product comparisions than satisficers, both before and after they make purchasing decisions
Maximizers take longer than satisficers to decide on a purchase
Maximizers spend more time than satisficers comparing their purchasing decisions to decisions of others
More likely to experience regret after a purchase, spend time thinking about hypothetical alternatives to the purchase they’ve made, and less positive about their decisions.
Maximiszing and regret, maximizing and the quality of decisions
Does choice create maximizers?

Maximizers vs. Satisficers
Maximizers engage in more product comparisions than satisficers, both before and after they make purch
Choice and Happiness
Choice has a clear and a powerful instrumental value: It enables people to get what they need and want in life. 200 years ago, Adam Smith observed that individual freedom of choice enusures the most efficient production and distribution of society’s goods.
> But as important as the instrumental value of choice maye be, choice relfects another value that might be even more important. Choice is what enables us to tell the worlds who we are and what we care about. Every choice is a testament to our sense of self determination.

Freedom to choose has expressive value - Choice is what enables us to tell the world who we are and what we care about. Every choice we make is a testament to our autonomy, and to our self-determination. We express ourselves, either consciously or sub-consciously in the clothes we wear, food we eat, hobbies we pursue - each of these choices have an expressive function, rather than a practical aspect
Animals learn that being exposed to inescapable shocks that nothing they did made a difference, they were helpless in controlling their own fate - learned helplessness. We can learn that we don’t have control over a few things. Learned helplessness can affect future motivation to try. It can detect future ability to detect that you have control over a few situations. It can lead to clinical depression. Our most fundamental sense of well being depends on our having the ability to exert control over our environment and recognizing that we do.
In the context of discussing choice and autonomy, it is interesting to note that in many ways, social ties actually decrease freedom, choice and autonomy. Marriage, is commitment ot a particular person that curtails freedom of sexual and emotional partners. And serious friendship imposes a lasting hold on you.
The time problem - Who has the time to meet people these days
Freedom or commitment
Second order decisions
Rule: A concept that you live by and follow and never break under any circumstances. Always putting on seat belt, not cheating on your partner. Following rules eliminates troublesome choices in your life. Having the discipline to live by the rules you make foryourself is another matter of course
Presumptions are like the default setting that are always in action and are present by default unless you change it. More passive. Like brushing your teeth every morning
Standards are less rigorous, but when we establish a standard, we are essentially dividing the world of options into two categories: options that meet the standard and options that don’t. More like satisficing than maximizing. Deciding that once we find something that meets our standards, we’l stick with it essentially takes away that area of decision making. Eg: Friendships. We are draw to people who meet our standards (intelligence, kindness, character, loyalty, wit), and then we stick to them.
