For all my VC friends out there, this is a [great read](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84699.Never_Eat_Alone) ;)


# Excerpt
_"Ask not what people can do for you, but what you can do for them"_

  
#### Create a Relationship Action Plan

-   Set goals for every 3 months and year, 3 years out.
-   Identify the people, places, and things required to meet those goals.
-   Reach out to the people who can help you achieve your goals.

#### Create a board of advisors to act as cheerleaders and supervisors.

-   Be bold and willing to ask; it never hurts to ask. 
-   Become an active member in clubs, and work up to being a leader.
-   Meet 1 new person per week, no matter where or how.
-   Research people before meeting them to find common interests.
   

#### Warm calling

-   mention a familiar person or organization
-   state your value proposition (what you can do for them)
-   talk only enough to set up a face-to-face meeting
-   aim high, then compromise

Invite people from different parts of your network to events so they get to know each other
The quality of time you spend with people is more important than the quantity.

 
Follow up within 12-24 hours of meeting someone

-   cite something specific you talked about
-   ask to meet again
-   offer them something so they want to meet again

#### Make a connection quickly

-   look them in the eyes
-   listen intently
-   ask personal questions
-   reveal your vulnerability
    
#### Connect with "super-connectors"

-   Super Connectors - well-connected people outside your profession
-   Avoid safe, boring talk. Talk about religion, romance, politics, and your passions.
-   Listen attentively and use people's names.

#### Help people with the 3 most important things: health, wealth, and children.

-   Become an indispensable power broker, helping others succeed. 
-   Ping your contacts at least a few times each year to stay in touch. Birthdays are the best time.
  
#### Throw dinner parties with a mix of people.

-   Use "anchor tenants" to bridge to others outside your social circle.  
-   Connect with the famous and powerful through organizations, clubs, conferences, fundraisers, nonprofit boards, sports, etc. If you can't find a club, start one!
