### Summary


##### The Mind-Set



*   Success breeds success. Poverty wasn’t just a lack of financial resources; it was isolation from the kind of people who could help you make more of yourself.”
*   Reaching out to people is a way to make a difference in people’s lives as well as a way to explore and learn and enrich your own
*   Networking is just connecting—sharing my knowledge and resources, time and energy, friends and associates, and empathy and compassion in a continual effort to provide value to others, while coincidentally increasing your own. 
*   Real networking is about finding ways to make other people more successful. It was about working hard to give more than you get.
*   What has become clear is that we’re not just connected to others. We are the very product of the people and networks to which we are connected. Who you know determines who you are—how you feel, how you act, and what you achieve.
*   The more specific you are about what you want to do, the easier it becomes to develop a strategy to accomplish it. Part of that strategy, of course, is establishing relationships

##### Build the Skill-Set


*   Do your homework: From your Networking Action Plan, develop your name list of specific people who can help you achieve your mission and short/mid term goals. Always Always prepare before a meeting.
*   Approaching new contacts: Learn how to warm up cold leads in advance (do not make cold calls) and manage gatekeepers artfully.
*   Be visible. Learn how to fill your social/events calendar with meaningful, productive events and share your passions.
*   Follow up consistently.
*   Master the art of small talk, with the goal of starting a conversation, engaging the other person and leaving with them with a deep liking for you.
*   Become a conference commando. Don’t attend conferences to listen to the speakers or sell your products. Your goal for conferences should be to meet like-minded people who can advance your mission. Get them to like you and set up follow-up discussions after the conference. Learn the tips to get the most from conferences you attend.
*   Expand your social circle. Learn how to connect with the super-connectors and link your circle with someone else’s.

#### Create a Relationship Action Plan

-   Set goals for every 3 months and year, 3 years out.
-   Identify the people, places, and things required to meet those goals.
-   Reach out to the people who can help you achieve your goals.

#### Create a board of advisors to act as cheerleaders and supervisors.

-   Be bold and willing to ask; it never hurts to ask. 
-   Become an active member in clubs, and work up to being a leader.
-   Meet 1 new person per week, no matter where or how.
-   Research people before meeting them to find common interests.
   

#### Warm calling

-   mention a familiar person or organization
-   state your value proposition (what you can do for them)
-   talk only enough to set up a face-to-face meeting
-   aim high, then compromise

Invite people from different parts of your network to events so they get to know each other
The quality of time you spend with people is more important than the quantity.

 
Follow up within 12-24 hours of meeting someone

-   cite something specific you talked about
-   ask to meet again
-   offer them something so they want to meet again

#### Make a connection quickly

-   look them in the eyes
-   listen intently
-   ask personal questions
-   reveal your vulnerability
    
#### Connect with "super-connectors"

-   Super Connectors - well-connected people outside your profession
-   Avoid safe, boring talk. Talk about religion, romance, politics, and your passions.
-   Listen attentively and use people's names.

#### Help people with the 3 most important things: health, wealth, and children.

-   Become an indispensable power broker, helping others succeed. 
-   Ping your contacts at least a few times each year to stay in touch. Birthdays are the best time.
  
#### Throw dinner parties with a mix of people.

-   Use "anchor tenants" to bridge to others outside your social circle.  
-   Connect with the famous and powerful through organizations, clubs, conferences, fundraisers, nonprofit boards, sports, etc. If you can't find a club, start one!



### In My Humble Opinion


#### Highlights

A lot of things that he mentions is something that my mom also preached and practices to this day. The author has some helpful tips for people who are looking for pointers to help in their networking journey


#### Lowlights

The book can come across as self-promotional and elitist to some extent. This book could’ve been shorter if not for the self-bragging stories which in my opinion doesn’t really line up with my idea of a successful network (Thousands of contacts, really?). The endless name dropping of famous people that the author met gets a tad annoying at the end. Overall, reading the summary and self-elaborating from there would be enough.


##### Related Books

I confused this book with [Simon Sinek’s](https://simonsinek.com/) book [Leaders Eat Last](https://www.amazon.com/Leaders-Eat-Last-Together-Others/dp/1543614620), which is in the same genre. Other titles that I’ve found to have overlapping content would be How to Win Friends and Influence People, and [Adam Grant’s](https://www.adamgrant.net/) [Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16158498-give-and-take).


##### Reading Tips

This book could’ve been a 5 piece blog post in all honesty. I found it good enough for a one-time read, but I wouldn’t keep it in my home library. If you’re looking to finish the book in a short time, I’d advise glancing over the headers and you should be able to summarize it yourself.
