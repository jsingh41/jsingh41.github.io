## Premise

Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) and Confidence Intervals are the two most popular techniques of inferential statistics, although many researches don’t fully understand how to correctly interpret p-values or confidence intervals. When researchers were asked the validity of 6 statements about p-values and CI, where all of them were incorrect, researchers endorsed 2.5 out of 6 statements for p-values and 3 out of 6 statements for CI.


## Summary


#### What is CI?



*   Numerical interval constructed around the estimate of a parameter.
*   It does not indicate any property of the parameter, it indicates the property of the procedure that was used to calculate the CI
*   It is incorrect to interpret it as the probability that the true value is in the interval 95% of the time. CIs do not allow us to make probability statements about parameters.


#### Criticism of NHST



*   Inability to provide the answers that the researchers are actually interested in
*   Violation of the likelihood principles
*   Its tendency to overestimate the evidence against the null hypothesis
*   Its dichotomization of evidence
*   Conceptually difficult to understand leading to misinterpretation
*   Oftentimes, NHST values are given a Bayesian interpretation, **such as when the p-value is interpreted as the probability that the null hypothesis is true.**


#### Reasons why CI should be used instead



*   CIs make precision salient, removing the dichotomy that comes with NHST
*   CIs give comprehensible point and interval information, and thus support substantive thinking and interpretation
*   CIs provide information about any hypothesis, while the NHST only gives information about the Null hypothesis
*   CIs are better designed to support meta analysis
*   Give direct insight into the precision of the procedure, so it can be used as an alternative to power calculations


#### Deep dive into NHST



*   NHST is based on frequentist statistics, where conclusions are based on the average value of a hypothetical experiment run an infinite number of times.
*   Doesn’t allow us to assign probabilities to parameters


#### Questionnaire

A research reports the CI for a mean to be in the range of 0.1 and 0.4. No further information was provided. Assess the following questions:



*   The probability that the true mean is greater than 0 is at least 95%.
*   The probability that the true mean equals 0 is smaller than 5%.
*   The “null hypothesis” that the true mean equals 0 is likely to be incorrect.
*   There is a 95% probability that the true mean lies between 0.1 and 0.4.
*   We can be 95 % confident that the true mean lies between 0.1 and 0.4.
*   If we were to repeat the experiment over and over, then 95% of the time the true mean falls between 0.1 and 0.4.


#### All statements are false



*   Statements 1-4 assign probabilities, which is not allowed in a frequentist framework
*   Statements 5 and 6 mention the boundaries of the CI (i.e., 0.1 and 0.4), whereas a CI can be used to evaluate only the procedure and not a specific interval. 
*   The correct statement, which was absent from the list, is the following: “If we were to repeat the experiment over and over, then 95 % of the time the confidence intervals contain the true mean.”
