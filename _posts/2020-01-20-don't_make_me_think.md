Don’t Make Me Think
Guiding Principles
A common sense approach to web and mobile usability
Don’t make me think!
Definition of usability:
Useful: Does it do something people need done?
Learnable: Can people figure out how to use it?
Memorable: Do they have to relearn it each time they use it?
Effective: Does it get the job done?
Efficient: Does it do it with a reasonable amount of time and effort?
Desirable: Do people want it?
Delightful: Is using it enjoyable, or even fun?
Clever names, marketing induced names shouldn’t be used if they make the person think additionally. AS a rule, people don’t like to puzzle over how to do things.
Make links and buttons that are obviously clickable
How we really use the web
Scanning, satisficing and muddling through
The user shouldn’t be spending their time thinking about these things:
Where am I?
Where should I begin?
Whre did they put ..?
What are the most important things on this page?
Why did they call it that?
Is that an ad or part of the site?
“If you can’t make things self-evident, you need to atleast make them self-explanatory”
“On the internet, the competition is always just one click away, so if you frustrate users they’ll head somewhere else”
Fact #1: We don’t read pages, we scan them
Fact #2: We don’t make optimal choices, we satisfice
Fact #3: We don’t figure out how things work, we muddle through
Create effective visual hirearchies
As users, we’ve come to have expectations about
Where things will be located on a page (logo on the top left corner)
How things work (cart for cart/method of payment(
How things look (the search icon)
Billboard design 101
Designing for scanning, not reading
Break up into clearly defined pages
Make it obvious what’s clickable
Keep the noise down to a dull roar
Format text to support scanning
Keep paragraphs short
Use bulleted lists
Highlight key terms
Why users like mindless choices
“It doesn’t matter how many times I have to click, as long as each click is a mindless, unambiguous choice”
AS long as each click is painless and they have continued confidence that they’re on the right track. Three mindless, unambiguous clicks equal one click that requires thought.
Omit needless words
The art of not writing for the web
“Get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of half of what’s left”
Happy talk must die
Insutrcutions must die

Things You Need to Get Right
Street signs and breadcrumbs
Designing navigation
Website navigation:
You are trying to find something
You decide whether to ask first or browse first
If you choose ot browse, you make your way through a heirarchy, using signs to guide you
The unbearable lightness of browsing
No sense of scale
No sense of direction
No sense of location
The overlooked purposes of navigation
It tells us what’s here
It tells us how to use the site
It gives us confidence in teh people who built it
Global navigation is helpful, but there are some pages where you want the user to be doing only one thing: such as paying
Having a home button is important because no matter where I am, I should be able to hit “reset”
Page Names
Page names should be big and easily viewable
Every page should have a name, the name needs to be in the right place, the name needs to be prominent
The name needs to match what you clicked
HIghlight the current location in whatever navigation bar
Try the trunk test. As quickly as possible, try to find and circle each of these items
Site ID
Page name
Sections (Primary navigation)
Local navigation
“You are here” indicators
Search
The home page has to accommodate
Site identity and mission
For some visitors, homepage will be the only chance your site gets to create a good impression
Everybody wants a piece of it
Since it is the homepage, it drives a lot of traffic
It is like the waterfront property of the web
The first casualty of war
Conveying the big picture
How to get the message across
The tagline
The welcome blurb
The learn more
Nothing beats a good tagline!
Clear and informative
Just long enough, but not too long
Convey differentiation
Shouldn’t sound generic
Personable, lively and sometime clever
Killing the golden goose - Trying to promote everything
Any shared resource will inevitably be destroyed by overuse (Tragedy of the commons)
Religious detabes: People expressiving strongly held personally believe about things that can’t be proven, and rarely result in anyone involved changing their point of view
“All web users are unique and all web use is basically idiosyncratic”
Things I want to use in a hurry or frequently should be close at hand. Everythign else can be a few taps away, but there should be an obvious path to get to them.
“Managing real estate channel shouldn’t be done at the cost of usability”
No cursor = no hover = no clue
Hover on tool tips, buttons that change share or color or menus that drop drown on hover aren’t present on mobile
Flat design
Be careful that your responsive design solutions aren’t loading up pages with huge amounts of code and images that are larger than necessary for the user’s screen
“A person of average ability and experience can figure out how to use the thing to accomplish something without it being more trouble than it’s worth
Delightful apps usually come from marrying an idea about something people would really enjoy being able to do , but don’t imagine is possible
Things that diminish good will
Hiding information that I want
Punishing me for not doing things your way
Asking me for information you don’t really need
Shucking and jiving me
Putting sizzle in my way
Your site looks amateurish
Things that increase goodwill
Know the main thhings that people want to do on your site and make them obvious and easy
Tell me what I want to know
Save me steps whereer you can
Put effort into it
Know what questions I’m likely to have, and answer them
Provide me with creative comforts liek printer friendly words
Make it easy to recover from errors
When in doubt, apologiese
