_In today’s age, we have all but rejected the foundational values of the West – that we are forged in God’s image, and that we are equipped with reason to explore the world. From these notions have come science, human rights, liberty and a belief in progress. By turning our backs on these values, our society is descending into tribalism. We must remind ourselves why the West is great before it’s too late._

In the book [The Right Side of History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Right_Side_of_History), [Ben Shapiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Shapiro) posits that America was founded on the twin notions of Judeo-Christian values and the Greek-born power of reason. 

The long philosophical journey that led to the formation of the first country in history to be crafted based on philosophy. Not only are human beings made in God’s image with will and reason, but with the liberty to exercise that will and reason in accordance with the pursuit of virtue.

##### Summary

**The pursuit of happiness**

Purpose is about working to build the framework for the pursuit of happiness, not the achievement of it; purpose helps us establish the preconditions necessary for happiness, but can’t provide happiness in and of itself. The government wasn’t there to give you happiness, the government was there to protect your pursuit of happiness. 

**Happiness is moral purpose**

Lasting happiness can be only achieved through cultivation of soul and mind. And cultivating our souls and minds requires us to live with moral purpose. 

Aristotle doesn’t define happiness as temporary joy. He saw happiness in a life well-lived. How could we live a good life? First, by determining what good means; second, by pursuing it. To Aristotle, good wasn’t a subjective term, something for each of us to define for ourselves; good was a statement of objective fact. Something was good if it fulfilled its purpose. A good watch tells time. What does a good human being do? Acts in accordance with the right reason. Act well, in accordance with your value as a rational being, and you will be happy. We find moral purpose in cultivating our reason, and using that reason to act virtuously; pursuing moral purpose makes us “great-souled”.

Happiness is the pursuit of purpose in our lives. 

We need four elements:  individual moral purpose, individual capacity to pursue that purpose, communal moral purpose, and communal capacity to pursue that purpose. 

**The necessity for individual moral purpose**

We all have inherent value, and our mission in life is to draw close to something beyond ourselves. Without individual moral purpose granted by a relationship to a Creator, we seek meaning instead in the collective, or we destroy ourselves on the shoals of libertinism. Without it, my interests are far more pressing than your rights, and atomistic individualism has a tendency to drift toward self-justifying oppression of others. 

If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him. 

**The necessity of individual capacity**

In order for us to be happy, we must believe that we can pursue that happiness with some degree of success. We must also assume that we exist as meaningful individuals, not mere clusters of cells. We’re not just balls of meat wandering through the universe. We are individuals with identities and responsibilities. 

We must believe in the power of our reason - our rational capacity. We have the ability to think things through. 

**The necessity for communal moral purpose**

What builds communities? A shared vision of what the community’s moral purpose is. The best countries, and the best societies are those where citizens are virtuous enough to sacrifice for the common good but unwilling to be forced to sacrifice for the “greater” good. Flourishing societies require a functional social fabric, created by citizens working together, and separately, towards a meaningful life. 

**The necessity for communal capacity**

The pursuit of individually and communally virtuous goals can only be effectuated when strong social institutions thrive - and when the government is both strong enough to protect against anarchy and limited enough to check its tendency toward tyranny. 

Tyranny rarely begins with jackboots; it usually begins with ardent wishes for a better future, combined with an unfailing faith in the power of mass mobilization. 

Communal capacity must somehow make room for us to purpose our individual moral purposes and exercise our individual capacity while also providing us the means to work together toward communal moral goals. It needs active social communities, promotion virtue, and a state nonrestrictive enough to provide a forum for our free choice. 

**The rise of the individual**

According to Locke, the formation of a government requires the exercise of consent - the goal of law is to preserve freedom, not to trade freedom away for security.

Smith posited that the government had three fundamental duties: preservation of life; preservation of liberty through administration of justice; and funding for public goods. 

After this, every man, as long as he doesn’t violate the law of justice, is left perfectly free to pursue his own interest his own way.

**The warning**

Dostoyevsky saw in the rise of an atheistic world the face of someone who embraced passion, discounted human responsibility, and saw in his own pleasure the highest good. He saw that the materialist man would be far more of a threat than religious man - that human beings who think of themselves as mere agglomerations of matter, without the responsibility of choice, will throw decency aside. 

**The Remaking of  the World**

Burke argued that the French Revolution had failed because it had ignored the lessons of human nature, the morality of Christianity, and the traditions of the past. The effect of liberty to individuals is that they may do as they please: We ought to see what it will please them to do, before we risk congratulations. He warned that the triumph of the supposed rationality over tradition and Judeo-Christian values would turn religion into a mere byword to be vulgarized by political forces: Their liberty is not liberal. Their humanity is savage and brutal.

**The Utopia of Nationalism**

Marx argued that mankind could be perfected through a program of rigorous and continuous revolution. Abolishingprivate property would end alienation; abolishing the family would end the exploitation of children by parents and wives by husbands. 

**How to Build**

As Ronald Reagan put it, “Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn’t pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same.”

**Four Simple Lessons**



1. **Your Life has Purpose. **Life is not a bewildering, chaotic mess. It’s a struggle, but it’s a struggle guided by a higher meaning. You were designed to use your reason and your natural gifts - and to cultivate those assets toward fulfillment of a higher end.
2. **You can Do It**. Forge forth and conquer. Build. Cultivate. You were given the ability to choose your path in life. Make the most of it. You are not a victim. Your successes are your accomplishments, but they are also the legacy of those who came before you and those who stand with you; your failures are purely your own. Look to your own house before blaming the society that bore you. You are a human being, made in the image of God, bound to the earth but with a soul that dreams of the eternal. There is no greater risk than that and no greater opportunity than that. 
3. **Your civilization is unique.** Recognize that what you have been give is unique in human history
4. **We are All Brothers and Sisters**. We are not enemies if we share a common cause. And our common cause is a civilization replete with purpose, both communal and individual.

**Are we all just mere mortals?**

I don’t think we are. Our parents live on in us - that when we accept our past, when we learn the lessons they teach us, when we recognize their wisdom even as we develop our own, we become a link in the chair of history. Our parents never die so long as we keep the flame of their ideals alive, and pass that flame along to our children.

It is our job to carry on the tradition. It is our job to push the task forward.
