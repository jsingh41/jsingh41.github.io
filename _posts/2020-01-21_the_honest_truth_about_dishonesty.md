The Honest Truth About Dishonesty

The book brings out how we combine wishful lying with the reality to create our own version of truth. Different type of dishonesty - wishful blindness
Lots of people who cheat just a little bit
Dishonesty was not an outcome of the cost benefit analysis. Neither the reward nor the probability of getting caught affected the fact that everyone cheated just a little. But then, these are college students, experiment conducted at MIT. People maybe did it more for pride than for actual money. Maybe the reward wasn’t high enough to cheat. It is hard to cheat and still feel good about their sense of integrity. We cheat to the level that allows us to think of ourselves as reasonably honest individuals.
The cheating increases as soon as there is one more step to actual cash - because stealing cash is wrong, everyone knows that. What about the future state of cashless society then? Will digital money separate us from the reality of our actions?
Dishonesty increases as we are more steps removed from money
1% of people are always honest. 1% of people are always dishonest. The rest 98% are honest as long as the conditions are right.
Merely trying to recall moral standards was enough to improve behavior
Having a lot on one’s mind would leave less cognitive room for resisting temptation and more likely for people to succumb to it.
Self signalling: Despite what we tend to think, we don’t have a clear idea of who we are.

Review
The book discusses the powerful ways irrationality affects our lives, and it begins with a critique of those who think dishonesty is a result of a rational cost-benefit calculation. In a series of experiments, Ariely neatly shows that neither the size of the reward nor the probability of getting caught substantially affects the likelihood of dishonest behavior. The cost-benefit framework for understanding cheating just doesn’t pay off. 
On the one hand, we want to view ourselves as honorable, and on the other hand, we want to get as much stuff as possible. We want the benefits of cheating, and we want to see “ourselves as honest, wonderful people.” So we fudge. We fool ourselves and others. Our “cognitive flexibility” cuts us so much slack that we often don’t perceive ourselves as getting away with anything. This flexibility keeps the contradictions between our principles and our behavior beyond the horizon of our consciousness. Psychological distance is key.

Mostly, small reminders of basic moral standards tend to improve behavior. The concept of “ego depletion” — that we can run out of the strength to do what we know we should — reminds us that willpower is a muscle. It takes energy to do the right thing.
