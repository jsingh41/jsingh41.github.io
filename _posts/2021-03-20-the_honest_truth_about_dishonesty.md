_Locks won't protect you from the thieves, who can get in your house if they really want to. They will only protect you from the mostly honest people who might be tempted to try your door if it has no lock._


## Premise

[The Honest Truth About Dishonesty: How We Lie to Everyone - Especially Ourselves](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/18912407-the-honest-truth-about-dishonesty-how-we-lie-to-everyone-especially-our) by [Dan Ariely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Ariely) uses an experimental approach to prove how we are all casual liars. In this funnily thought-provoking book, the author describes two opposing forces - our desire to maximize our economic prospects by cheating, balanced with our psychological desire to be able to view ourselves as wonderful human beings.

## About the Author

Dan Ariely is a professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University.Ariely was named one of the 50 most influential living psychologists in the world in 2018. He has written several books on psychology and behavioral economics, such as [Predictably Irrational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictably_Irrational), [The Upside of Irrationality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Upside_of_Irrationality), and [The Honest Truth About Dishonesty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honest_Truth_about_Dishonesty).


## The Big Ideas



* A lot of the dishonesty arises from wishful blindness rather than deliberate dishonesty. Dishonesty in the society is largely because of a few bad apples, but everyone cheats just a little bit.
* Decisions about honesty, like most other decisions, are based on a cost-benefit analysis and not on a right vs. wrong analysis.
* We are going to cheat, and take things from each other, and many people need controls around them to do the right thing.


## Summary



* 1% of people are always honest. 1% of people are always dishonest. The rest 98% are honest as long as the conditions are right.
* It is hard to cheat and still feel good about their sense of integrity. We cheat to the level that allows us to think of ourselves as reasonably honest individuals.
* On the one hand, we want to view ourselves as honorable, and on the other hand, we want to get as much stuff as possible. We want the benefits of cheating, and we want to see “ourselves as honest, wonderful people.” So we fudge. We fool ourselves and others. Our “cognitive flexibility” cuts us so much slack that we often don’t perceive ourselves as getting away with anything.
* This flexibility keeps the contradictions between our principles and our behavior beyond the horizon of our consciousness. Psychological distance is key.
* Mostly, small reminders of basic moral standards tend to improve behavior. The concept of “ego depletion” — that we can run out of the strength to do what we know we should — reminds us that willpower is a muscle. It takes energy to do the right thing.
* Merely trying to recall moral standards was enough to improve behavior. Having a lot on one’s mind would leave less cognitive room for resisting temptation and more likely for people to succumb to it.
* The cheating increases as soon as there is one more step to actual cash - because stealing cash is wrong, everyone knows that. What about the future state of cashless society then? Will digital money separate us from the reality of our actions?


## In My Humble Opinion

The book discusses the powerful ways irrationality affects our lives, and it begins with a critique of those who think dishonesty is a result of a rational cost-benefit calculation. In a series of experiments, Ariely neatly shows that neither the size of the reward nor the probability of getting caught substantially affects the likelihood of dishonest behavior. The cost-benefit framework for understanding cheating just doesn’t pay off. He is a funny behavioral economist. His previous book, Predictably Irrational was my first foray in behavior economics. In this book, he uses an experimental approach to prove how we are all casual liars.

This book was fascinating and enlightening about how we are all, in a way deluding ourselves into believing that we are perfectly honest people. This book lies at the intersection of psychology, economics and morality. 

Even though this is a book based on academic research, it is not a dry, abstract treatise. Written in easily-understood language, this is a smart and perceptive book that teaches us about basic human behavior.
