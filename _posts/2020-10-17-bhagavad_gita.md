I had binge watched [Mahabharat](https://www.hotstar.com/us/tv/mahabharat/435) a few months ago, and was surprised by Krishna's teachings. Intrigued, I wanted to read the Gita in detail, and chanced upon this [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21981616-the-bhagavad-gita). I wish I had the time to write in more depth, but here are the excerpts from the book.

Gita is a conversation that happens between Krishna and Arjun, at the cusp of the Kurukshetra war. The ensuing dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna goes far beyond a rationale for war. It touches on many of the ethical dilemmas, religious practices, and philosophical issues that concerned the Indian elites of ancient times.
Like those more extensive bibles of other traditions, the Gita is internally complex and ambiguous enough to have spoken differing truths to different audiences, as suited to their diverse situations and expectations.
* Though his body is shaking and his mind is spinning, Arjuna is able to articulate to Krishna the main causes of his distress. One is psychological. He feels deep pity and grief over the deaths sure to ensue during the battle. He sees no possible good that could compensate for the terrible losses from a war involving kin. The other is moral. Arjuna is confused as to his duty (dharma) in this situation. On the one hand, his responsibility as a member of the warrior class is to engage in appropriate battle. On the other hand, he owes a duty of protection to his own family members. When family obligations are not observed, Arjuna argues, the entire social order collapses. The opposite side in this battle is filled with Arjuna’s relatives. So Krishna’s efforts at persuasion must start with these two issues.

 
* The truly learned person, the charioteer begins, does not grieve over those who are dead and those not dead. The dead do not cease to exist. Krishna’s assertion here rests on the premise of transmigration or metempsychosis: that a person’s essential spirit or soul existed already before birth, and will continue to exist after death.

* As for Arjuna’s dilemma over conflicting duties, Krishna responds succinctly. Your duty as a member of the warrior class, to fight in a righteous battle, the charioteer asserts, trumps any obligations you may feel toward other members of your family.

* Religious philosophers of various schools (Buddhist and Jain as well as Hindu) identified desire, the primary motivation for action, to be a fundamental problem. **Undertaking an act out of desire, they maintained, leads to bondage.** The key term here is _karma_, which in its primary usage simply denotes action. In classical India, however, karma also had come to refer to the persisting moral consequences of actions. (It is in this extended sense that the term has been incorporated into the modern English lexicon.) 
* Many envisioned karma as a residue that adhered to a person’s self or soul, like some kind of opaque grime that obscured its intrinsic clarity. This buildup of karma caused a soul to be reborn again and again in bondage to the world of suffering. **The way to avoid this bondage, therefore, was to avoid all desire-based action.** And to accomplish this, it was necessary to leave behind one’s familial and social responsibilities, and become a renouncer. 
* As a homeless mendicant, one could avoid acting out of desire, practice disciplines of meditation and austerity, and seek a state of liberation from all bondage—a state that transcended human suffering. Hindus most often called it moksha, Buddhists termed it nirvana, and Jains designated it kaivalya, but all the advocates of renunciation viewed it as the highest state.

* One can act without being driven by desire, says Krishna. The key is to avoid any attachment to the results (or fruits) of your action.

* Your obligation is to the action, and never to its fruits. Do not be motivated by the fruit of your actions. But do not become attached to non-action, either. Abandon your attachment and engage in worldly action, Arjuna, while standing firm in discipline (yoga). Consider success and failure to be equal. This equanimity is called discipline, Arjuna, since the action itself is much less important than the discipline of the intellect. 
 
* One need not, and in fact should not, avoid worldly action. To avoid the bondage that results from actions driven by desires, however, one must avoid any attachment to the ends or fruits of that action. One must maintain a mental equanimity toward the outcome. This requires a firm disciplining of the mind. Arjuna should fight in the war, as it is his class duty to do so, and if he does this without any concern for success or failure, without desire for any fruits of victory or fear of defeat, no bondage of action will attach to him.
