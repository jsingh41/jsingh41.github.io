Interest in the program

I have been asked many times as to how I got into MIT. And sometimes I’m not sure if the question really meant what I did to get into MIT, or what you should be doing to get into MIT

I’m writing this blog as I get a lot of questions everyday about my experience at MIT, more specifically how did I make it to the MFin program from prospective applicants. I am writing this post to document my experience while applying for finance programs in the US, and specifically what I think I did right to get into MIT’s MFin program. This might be helpful to those candidates who are thinking of applying, or what entails applying in a program


My background

I truly believe that all masters programs look at the candidates applications holistically, and you can make up for the lack of excellence in one field by being really good at something else. As long as you are able to make your application stand out from the pool of applicants, you will be okay. This is a very broad and vague statement, and has two flaws: You don’t know what the vast majority of applications look like, and secondly, you don’t know what quality of yours will make you stand out (or at least for most people, including myself, it wasn’t that apparent). What most people fail to realize is that having a consistently amazing performance throughout their lives is also an amazing thing, because not a lot of people are able to achieve it. I have classmates who were doing the MFin program after finishing a PhD in Math (one end), and those who did not have a finance background, but were very well-rounded individuals

Broadly, these are the factors that the admit committee is looking at:

Undergraduate: This can be broken down into three separate parts
Reputation of your undergraduate college
Your undergraduate GPA
Your undergraduate major/minor
Your undergraduate activity
GRE
Your extracurricular activities
Your SOP: I think this is the most critical part of your application and should not be taken lightly at any cost. This probably makes or breaks your case for the adcom. 
What it should be: Your story, that hasn’t been captured in your resume. I personally believe that at the end of writing the first draft of my SOP, I knew myself better than before, because I had never thought so long and hard about the kind of person I am, what drives me, what excites me. And incidentally, it was this self-knowledge that confirmed my belief that pursuing a finance degree was what I wanted to do at that point of time, and I guess I was able to show that to the adcom as well. I did not use any fancy words, but I did put conviction in my essay. In all honesty, I have reviewed a lot of applications, and I find that most of them are just a repeat of what their resume already tells me/recital of their resume, or just a patched up work of trying to put a story to their lives. What did you learn from your work experience? How did a particular experience help you shape as a person? Your ability to reflect on your life also speaks loads about your intellect, and it is a common theme I’ve found in the SOPs of my peers that I’ve reviewed - Their SOP was good enough to paint a picture of how they think, how I would expect them to behave in real life. It is half-n-half of introspection and self-marketing. Be specific. Be specific. It is okay if you didn’t know what you were doing in your first year undergrad, it is okay if you have a GPA of 7.5, they will cover that in your interview anyway. if you are able to tell them the essay you write about why you want to attend graduate school in a particular field, and what your qualifications are. In some fields, admissions committees care about things like undergraduate research, writing samples, your work or internship history, or an in-person interview. Do not expect to nail your SOP in the first attempt itself. Having read your SOP some 100 times, you will fail to see its weakness, so make sure you get feedback from different kinds of people. 
Recommendations: You can actually make a huge difference here. Make sure your recommenders have more to say than that you are great student, in the top 1% they’ve never seen before. Recommendation should be honest. I remember my reco talked about how I was able to turn around my GPA from 6.5 at the end of first year to an 8.6 in the end. Go into specifics. Talk about individual examples. Stay away from generic statements that only add clutter to that one page.
Your interest in the program
Why I chose this program over others
I chose this program for several reasons
MIT: The name says it all.
1-year program: Mind you, one year doesn’t mean that the program is going to be easy, or it will have less load. In-fact, as we had to finish our required credits in the time that most people take 2 years for, it was extra hard. Combine this with the difficulty of adjusting in a new environment, getting used to .., networking, finding a job in a span of one year, and also trying to find time to enjoy life. 
Which other programs did I get into


How did I apply. What was the application procedure
What do I think matters the most in the application
What set me apart?
How was my SOP written?
Any general advice that I can give to people applying
What was the profile of people who got in in my batch?
Terrific. Top-notch. The people I met in my program were the smartest I’ve come across. As for Indians, here is the detailed breakdown of students
There were 8 Indian citizens accepted in the program. Out of them, 2 were straight out of college, with outstanding academics and extra-curricular activities and top schools (IIT-B, LSR). 2 of us had worked in reputed financial firms for 2 years, and came from BITS. The rest 4 had 3-4 years of work experience in reputed financial institutions in India and all pursued their undergrad in quantitative fields from IITs. I can safely say that I learnt from my peers as much as I learnt from the college itself.
