This is an absolute gem of a [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18197267-don-t-make-me-think-revisited). In my personal opinion, this book will benefit anyone who works with a website - backend, frontend, designer, product manager, data scientist or even the general reader.

# Excerpt

A common sense approach to web and mobile usability

*   Definition of usability:
    *   Useful: Does it do something people need done?
    *   Learnable: Can people figure out how to use it?
    *   Memorable: Do they have to relearn it each time they use it?
    *   Effective: Does it get the job done?
    *   Efficient: Does it do it with a reasonable amount of time and effort?
    *   Desirable: Do people want it?
    *   Delightful: Is using it enjoyable, or even fun?
*   Clever names, marketing induced names shouldn’t be used if they make the person think additionally. AS a rule, people don’t like to puzzle over how to do things.
*   Make links and buttons that are obviously clickable
*   How we really use the web
    *   Scanning, satisficing and muddling through
*   The user shouldn’t be spending their time thinking about these things:
    *   Where am I?
    *   Where should I begin?
    *   Where did they put ..?
    *   What are the most important things on this page?
    *   Why did they call it that?
    *   Is that an ad or part of the site?
*   “If you can’t make things self-evident, you need to at-least make them self-explanatory”
*   “On the internet, the competition is always just one click away, so if you frustrate users they’ll head somewhere else”
    *   Fact #1: We don’t read pages, we scan them
    *   Fact #2: We don’t make optimal choices, we satisfice
    *   Fact #3: We don’t figure out how things work, we muddle through
*   Create effective visual hierarchies
*   As users, we’ve come to have expectations about
        *   Where things will be located on a page (logo on the top left corner)
        *   How things work (cart for cart/method of payment(
        *   How things look (the search icon)
*   **Billboard design 101**
    *   Designing for scanning, not reading
        *   Break up into clearly defined pages
        *   Make it obvious what’s clickable
        *   Keep the noise down to a dull roar
        *   Format text to support scanning
        *   Keep paragraphs short
        *   Use bulleted lists
        *   Highlight key terms
*   **Why users like mindless choices**
*   “It doesn’t matter how many times I have to click, as long as each click is a mindless, unambiguous choice”
*   As long as each click is painless and they have continued confidence that they’re on the right track. Three mindless, unambiguous clicks equal one click that requires thought.
*   **Omit needless words**
*   The art of not writing for the web
*   “Get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of half of what’s left”
*   Happy talk must die
*   Instructions must die

Things You Need to Get Right


*   **Street signs and breadcrumbs**
*   Designing navigation
*   Website navigation:
    *   You are trying to find something
    *   You decide whether to ask first or browse first
    *   If you choose to browse, you make your way through a hierarchy, using signs to guide you
    *   The unbearable lightness of browsing
        *   No sense of scale
        *   No sense of direction
        *   No sense of location
    *   The overlooked purposes of navigation
        *   It tells us what’s here
        *   It tells us how to use the site
        *   It gives us confidence in the people who built it
    *   Global navigation is helpful, but there are some pages where you want the user to be doing only one thing: such as paying
    *   Having a home button is important because no matter where I am, I should be able to hit “reset”
    *   Page Names
        *   Page names should be big and easily viewable
        *   Every page should have a name, the name needs to be in the right place, the name needs to be prominent
        *   The name needs to match what you clicked
        *   Highlight the current location in whatever navigation bar
    *   Try the trunk test. As quickly as possible, try to find and circle each of these items
        *   Site ID
        *   Page name
        *   Sections (Primary navigation)
        *   Local navigation
        *   “You are here” indicators
        *   Search
    *   The home page has to accommodate
        *   Site identity and mission
    *   For some visitors, homepage will be the only chance your site gets to create a good impression
    *   Everybody wants a piece of it
    *   Since it is the homepage, it drives a lot of traffic
        *   It is like the waterfront property of the web
    *   The first casualty of war
        *   Conveying the big picture
    *   How to get the message across
        *   The tagline
        *   The welcome blurb
        *   The learn more
    *   Nothing beats a good tagline!
        *   Clear and informative
        *   Just long enough, but not too long
        *   Convey differentiation
        *   Shouldn’t sound generic
        *   Personable, lively and sometime clever
    *   Killing the golden goose - Trying to promote everything
    *   Any shared resources will inevitably be destroyed by overuse (Tragedy of the commons)
*   Religious debates: People expressing strongly held personally believe about things that can’t be proven, and rarely result in anyone involved changing their point of view
*   “All web users are unique and all web use is basically idiosyncratic”
*   Things I want to use in a hurry or frequently should be close at hand. Everything else can be a few taps away, but there should be an obvious path to get to them.
*   “Managing real estate channel shouldn’t be done at the cost of usability”
*   No cursor = no hover = no clue
*   Hover on tool tips, buttons that change share or color or menus that drop-drown on hover aren’t present on mobile
*   Flat design
    *   Be careful that your responsive design solutions aren’t loading up pages with huge amounts of code and images that are larger than necessary for the user’s screen
*   “A person of average ability and experience can figure out how to use the thing to accomplish something without it being more trouble than it’s worth
*   Delightful apps usually come from marrying an idea about something people would really enjoy being able to do , but don’t imagine is possible
*   Things that diminish good will
    *   Hiding information that I want
    *   Punishing me for not doing things your way
    *   Asking me for information you don’t really need
    *   Shucking and jiving me
    *   Putting sizzle in my way
    *   Your site looks amateurish
*   Things that increase goodwill
    *   Know the main things that people want to do on your site and make them obvious and easy
    *   Tell me what I want to know
    *   Save me steps wherever you can
    *   Put effort into it
    *   Know what questions I’m likely to have, and answer them
    *   Provide me with creative comforts like printer friendly words
    *   Make it easy to recover from errors
    *   When in doubt, apologize
