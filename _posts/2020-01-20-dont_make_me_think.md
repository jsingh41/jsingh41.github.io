## Premise

[Don’t Make Me Think](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758) by [Steve Krug](https://sensible.com/) is a classic book on website design and usability. The premise of the book is that a good website should let the user understand and navigate the website **as** easily as possible, so they can accomplish their task at hand with the least amount of cognitive load. The author also talks about how people really use websites, some of the common pitfalls in designing websites, and the principles that help make a website elegant and accessible. 


## About the Author

[Steve Krug](https://sensible.com/) is a usability/UX consultant best known for the author of Don’t Make Me Think. He also consults through his firm, Advanced Common Sense.


## The Big Ideas



*   The way to ascertain whether a website or a design is useful is when a person of average (or below average) ability and experience can use it without assistance


## Summary


#### Krug’s first law of usability: Don’t make me think



*   Your goal should be for each page to be self-evident, so that just by looking at it the average user will know what it is and how to use it. As far as humanly possible, your website should be self explanatory and reduce the user’s cognitive load. Occam’s Razor - The simplest way is usually the right one. 
*   What makes people think?
    *   Too many words
    *   Complicated words that don’t get to the point
    *   Confusing icons


#### How we really use the web : Scanning, satisficing, and muddling through



*   We don’t read pages, we scan them, just like we don’t read words, we scan them. We specifically scan for our interest - the task at hand, our personal interest, and hardwired trigger words, such as “Free!”
*   We are usually in a rush while browsing, and go with the first reasonable option. In this case, we don’t maximize, we satisfice. In most web-browsing, the penalty of making a sub-optimal choice is not much (atleast for the user, it may be a LOT for the website builders)
*   We don’t figure out how things work - We muddle through. How many of us actually read instruction manuals, unless we’ve failed multiple times, and quite often miserably, before giving that a thought? In web-browsing, most of the time, muddling through is the fastest way to get to your objective.
*   Websites should be designed like billboards - Not for reading, but for scanning


#### Create a visual hierarchy, with three traits:



    *   The more important something is, the more prominent it is
    *   Things that are related logically are also related visually. Things are nested visually to show what’s part of what.
    *   Stick to conventions unless you know you have a better idea and everyone you show it to agrees


#### Krug’s second law of usability: Users like mindless choices

**“**It doesn’t matter how many times I have to click, as long as each click is a mindless, unambiguous choice**”**


#### Krug’s third law of usability: Omit needless words

People are only scanning and muddling, anyway. The two most common types of needless words are:



*   Happy talk - When you listen to happy talk very carefully, you can actually hear a tiny voice in the back of your head going “Blah blah blah”. It is mostly self-congratulatory or promotional, and doesn’t add any value to the user.
*   Instructions - Instead of adding instructions, try making everything self-explanatory


#### Designing navigation

If you compare an actual physical store with a website, there are three main differences that emerge in navigating the website:



*   Websites have **no sense of scale**
    *   Unless the website is very small, or we are ultra-familiar with it, we cannot tell how big or small (in terms of number of webpages) the website is. When we browse a magazine, or a store, the sense of scale is much more obvious. Even the people who manage websites often have very little idea how big their sites really are.
*    Websites have **no sense of direction**
    *   On a website, there is no up, down, left, right. We have to remember where it is in the conceptual hierarchy. 
    *   This is why the back button accounts for 30-40% of all web clicks. 
*   Websites have **no sense of location**
    *   In physical areas, we get an idea of the space as we move around the space. We develop a sense of where things are and take shortcuts to get there.
    *   This is also why homepages are so important - It is the north star of web navigation. You can always start afresh from the homepage.


#### The problem with designing homepages

Homepages have a lot of ground to cover - Site identity and mission, site hierarchy, search, teases, timely content, deals, shortcuts, registration, make what I want obvious, show me where to start, establish credibility and trust, etc. Oh, and:



*   Everybody wants a piece of it - This is prime estate
*   Everybody wants to work on it - Too many cooks in the house
*   It has to be one size fits all - Should appeal to every kind of user


#### Usability testing



*   If you want a great website, you’ve got to test with other users. When you “tour” your website with new users, you get to see your website in a new light, and you also realize some things that are obvious to you but may not be obvious to a new pair of eyes.
*   Testing one user a 100 percent is better than testing none. Testing one user early in the project is better than testing 50 users in the end. 
*   The importance of recruiting representative users is overrated. It is much more important to test early and loosely than to wait for a representative set. “Recruit loosely, and grade on a curve”


## In My Humble Opinion

This book is chock full of insights about how to build a more usable website. As a product data scientist working in tech, I have seen many principles from this book being used in designing websites - such as global navigation, breadcrumbs, homepage design etc., but it is important to understand _why_ we’re doing it instead of blindly following the established norms. This book is the industry standard when it comes to website design. It is easier to complicate things, it takes a lot of hard work and thought to keep things simple and elegant. 


### Highlights

One thing that I thoroughly enjoyed while reading the book where the images and screenshots of other companies’ websites. This book was written in the 2000s, and looking at the website designs from the 2000s really makes me think about how far we’ve come in terms of making things obvious. True to what it preaches, the book excels on its brevity and focus. There wasn’t a single page that I felt that the author could’ve cut it short. The insights per words metric for this book is really, really high. 

It is also a very practical book that anyone who works with UX design can apply in their work very easily. 


### Lowlights

Given that this book has been around for a long time and is almost a textbook for people who work with design, I would love to read an updated version of this book, that deals with more recent issues and concerns around UX design. 


## What Can You Do


#### Designing your website



*   Nothing important should ever be more than two clicks away. 
*   Get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of half of what’s left.
*   Design pages for scanning, not reading
*   Create a clear visual hierarchy on each page
*   Make it obvious what’s clickable
*   Minimize noise. White space is your friend
*   Break up pages into clearly defined areas


#### Designing navigation



*   The Site ID: Put the Site ID on every page, in a consistent location, preferably the top-left of the page, where it frames the page. This tells users which site they are on, and they should not lose sight of it. Make it look like a Site ID, like a brand or a logo. Make this the home page.
*   Sections: Put utilities, i.e. things that help the user use the site, like “My Accounts”, “Settings” should be easily accessible, but shouldn’t crowd the space too much. It is best to keep 4-5 most used utilities in the persistent navigation and keep the rest in the footer.
*   Keep the search box simple: No fancy words, no instructions, no other options that might create confusion around the search box
*   Design pages the right way
    *   Have a name for every page
    *   The name should be prominent
    *   The name should match what the user clicked
*   Add breadcrumbs: The best you are here. Home > Section 1 > Sub-section 2
*   Use tabs wherever possible
    *   They are self-evident, hard to miss, slick, suggest a physical space
    *   Make the active tab appear in the front, and color-code it


#### Designing homepages



*   Use a prominent tagline
    *   Good taglines are clear and informative, and just long enough. They convey **differentiation** and a **clear benefit**, and are NOT generic.

         Under 6-8 words is the sweet spot.

    *   They are personal, lively, and sometimes clever - only if clever helps convey the message. Some companies, like Amazon or Netflix are already household names, and you can assume that almost everyone knows that it is about, so they can get by without a tagline
    *   For eg: Coursera’s tagline is “Learn Without Limits”
*   Prominent but terse welcome blurb (I think this is largely outdated now, I don’t see many websites having a welcome statement anymore)


## Related Books

I think the Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman accompanies this book really well.


## Reading Tips

This is a short book, which I appreciate, and true to his word, every sentence has been carefully chosen and pruned to convey the message in as few words as possible, which really appeals to my logical mind. I would urge you to read this book instead of listening to it in an audio format - The visuals really help in contextualizing the author’s points. If you are someone who works with website designs, I would also encourage you to take notes wherever possible, or simple copy the “What You Can Do” section from this page. 

I hope you feel as delighted as I was when I first read the book.
