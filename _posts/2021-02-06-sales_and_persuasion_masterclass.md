## MasterClass: Sales and Persuasion


#### Sales Trends

Sales has changed more in the last 10 years than in the previous 100. Learn the most important developments and how they affect your ability to persuade.



*   40% of our time on the job is spent in something akin to sales - influencing, persuasion, cajoling, etc.
*   Your job skills are elastic today. It means being much more versatile, and not focussing 100% on your specialization. One of those skills is sales and persuasion.
*   Sales is not what it used to be, because of information. Now, we have information symmetry. Before, a seller could rip a buyer off because most of the information resided with the seller.
*   But now, buyers have lots of information and choices, and lots of ways to talk back.


#### Attunement: Finding Common Ground

To persuade effectively, you need to get inside the head of your counterpart and understand their perspective. Learn how to attune yourself to their state of mind and cultivate a meaningful connection.



*   Attunement is seeing the world through their eyes, instead of our eyes
*   We can’t force people to do things - inside a marketplace, or an organization
*   Find common ground, understand where they’re coming from, and come up with a solution
*   Knowing someone else’s perspective allows you to become a better persuader, because you know where they’re coming from
*   **Decrease your power to increase your effectiveness**
    *   There is an inverse relationship between feelings of power and perspective taking. The more power you feel in general, the less perspective-taking you become. People who are low in power are excellent perspective takers because they don’t have the resources. Power distorts the way they view themselves and other people.
    *   Reduce your feelings of power to increase your perspective-taking ability
*   **Use your head as much as your heart**
    *   Empathy is a fraternal twin of perspective-taking. Empathy is from the heart, perspective-taking is from the head
    *   When we’re in a persuasive encounter, you want to get both the emotional channel and the cognitive channel, but that’s hard. In a commercial encounter, get rid of the feelings (if you’ve to drop something).
    *   When in doubt, use your head as much, if not more, as your heart
    *   Use emotions as a signal


#### Serve Your Audience

Daniel teaches you how putting a purposeful, personal touch on your persuasive encounters can make all the difference.



*   What we do as persuaders is to serve other people. If we think of it as a form of service, we’re going to do them better, and do better things.
*   To be a good persuader is to be a decent human being
*   **Make it personal and make it purposeful**
    *   Don’t think about what you’re doing as an abstraction. Put a human face on it.
    *   Example: Radiology experiment. Control: Only X-ran, test: X-ray and photo of the person
        *   Test radiologists were more meticulous adn more time
        *   When showed the same scan without the photographs, it made the results worse
    *   We don’t have things to be abstractions
    *   Making it purposeful: Ask yourself, if the other person does what you want them to do, will they be better off, and will the world be better off? If the answer to either question is no, rethink what you’re doing.


#### Clarity: Making Your Message Count

Learn how strategic communication can mean the difference between success and failure in an information-saturated era.



*   Clarity is the ability to see a situation in a fresh light and help surface problems that people didn’t know they had.
*   Before, expertise was defined as having privileged access to information
*   The world is moving from access to information as an advantage to curating information. Can you separate out the signal from noise? Can you make sense of the information. IT is moving away from problem-solving to problem-identifying.
    *   Your customer needs you more when they don’t know what the problem is. If they knew what the problem is, finding solutions is easier
    *   Identifying hidden problems is where sales shine
*   Even if people know how to get information, people may not know how to make sense of it. Curators find out information that is meaningful, helpful in the context, and reliable.
*   Focus on the 1%, don’t get lost in the weeds
    *   There’s a body of knowledge, what’s the 1% that explains the other 99%
    *   What’s the 1% of the story that you’re telling - Ask yourself when you’re bogged down by the details
*   We have overvalued addition, and undervalued subtraction. 
*   3 arguments are more than enough to make your case. Don’t get to the fourth argument, it deteriorates the case


#### Getting Others to Act

The key to getting someone to do something is to make them think it was their idea. Learn about the dangers of coercion and how to persuade others by finding common ground instead.



*   Instead of doing something for someone else, set up a situation in which they can do themselves for themselves. When they have their own reason for doing it, they’re more likely to do it and to sustain their behavior.
*   Don’t irritate, agitate!
    *   Irritation is trying to get somebody to do something that you want them to do
    *   Agitation is trying to get somebody to do something they ought to do
*   Motivational interviewing
    *   Ask two irrational questions, to get them to articulate their own reasons to doing something. When people have their own reasons to doing something, they are more likely to do it.
*   Bring social proof
*   Build an off-ramp: Addressing people by name is helpful. Adding specifics is helpful.


#### Create a Connection by Mimicking

Humans are natural mimickers. If you’re aware of how this tendency can connect you to someone else, then you can deploy it strategically.



*   Mimicry is important. Human beings are natural mimickers. The three steps to strategic mimicry are:
    *   Watch - Pay attention, how somebody is sitting, are they intense, which way are they leaning, what words are they using
    *   Wait - Wait, pick one of those things. Count to ten, and do what they’re doing (eg: leaning back, or put their hand on the chin)
    *   Wane - 
*   The way that we understand somebody’s point of view is by inhibiting their body language. You understand where they’re coming from and find common ground. 
*   Mimicking with language: Use other people’s words as much as you can.


#### Persuasive Framing

Discover how taking advantage of innate glitches in the human mind can help you craft your messages for maximum efficacy.



*   People are stimulus rich but context poor.
*   Loss aversion: We experience losses more severely than the equivalent gain. You want to put the loss frame around the context. Tell people what they have to lose.
*   The opportunity frame: Opportunity cost is any time you’re doing something, you forego doing something else.
*   The experience frame: When social scientists look at what people remember, and what they value. They tend to value experiences more than goods and services. They derive satisfaction not from the TV, but the “movie night” with the family. Take what you’re selling - whether an idea or a product, and put it in the specific of an experience. Elevate your offer by putting it in the experience frame.
*   The less is more frame: Offering people choices can be persuasive, but only up to a point.Choice is valuable, but it has a ceiling on it. More isn’t better, better is better. Fewer options can be much more clarifying.
*   The contrast frame: If something is cheap, or expensive or worse, it is compared to what?
*   The blemish frame: Adding a small blemish (inconsequential negative) helps set the contrast frame. If something has a long list of positives, and you also reveal the small imperfect, it helps users to put the long list of positives in contrast. It shines the light on all other positives by triggering the “compared to what” question.
*   The potential frame: Buyers tend to overvalue potential. By emphasizing potential, that creates uncertainty that people like to fill in
*   The sunk cost fallacy: People tend to overvalue costs that have already sunk. You want to look at things prospectively, rather than retrospectively
*   The anchoring frame: The first thing that people hear has a disproportionate effect on how they think than you would imagine. According to this, you should go in with your number to set the terms of a negotiation


#### Pitching Like a Pro

Daniel explains why the elevator pitch is a thing of the past and shares a variety of pitches you can use to sell an idea, a product, or even yourself.



*   The pitches that were effective weren’t the broadway act, but the ones that invite the other side in as a collaborator
*   The objective of a pitch is to begin a conversation and a collaboration. The purpose of a pitch is not to get a yes right there, it is to start a conversation and build a collaboration.
*   The question pitch: The question pitch is a very effective tool. When the facts are very strongly on your side, questions are way more persuasive than statements. “Are you better off now than four years ago?”
*   When people reach your conclusions on their own, it is more conclusive for them   
*   The rhyming pitch: “See the USA in a Chevrolet”. The message goes down easily, which makes it easier to absorb, and believe.
*   The Pixar pitch: Every pixar story has a same basic narrative:
    *   Once upon a time..
    *   Everyday
    *   One day…
    *   Because of that…
    *   Because of that…
    *   Finally…
*   The one word pitch: Own one word. When people think of you, they think of that word. When they think of that word, they think of you. 
    *   What company comes to mind when you say “Search”. Most people say “Google”. When someone says “Google”, you’re most likely to think “Search”
    *   Exercise to hone your message. If you can distil what you stand for in a single word, you’re doing it right. 
    *   What’s our one word pitch as a company? Learning
    *   When Barrack Obama ran for president, it was hope. For re-relection, it was forward.
    *   What’s your one word pitch?
*   Write email subject lines that people will want to open
    *   Utility: What I’m suggesting in email is valuable to you
    *   Curiosity: Intrigued enough to open it up


#### Buoyancy: Develop a Resilient Mindset

Learn how to remain afloat in a sea of rejection as Daniel shares some of his favorite tips for staying positive.



*   People are going to say no many more times than they’re going to say yes. Hating rejection is in some ways like hating the weather, you can’t really do anything about it, you just have to equip yourself with it.
*   While positive self talk can be valuable, what is more effective is interrogative self talk. Can I do this. If I can, how do I do it? This helps answer your own questions and increase your performance.
*   Changing your explanatory style: How do you explain your failure or rejections. Lot of us use stories that are personally debilitating and often inaccurate. Human being don’t like rejections. It seems like a catastrophe. How do we de-catastrophize rejection?
*   The three Ps: Personal, Pervasive, Permanent. This is our tendency when we face rejection.
    *   Personal: _It is all my fault_. Is that accurate? Maybe there are other external reasons
    *   Pervasive: _This always happens._ Does it? There have been times when you’ve prevailed, you’ve got what you wanted. It just so happens that this time you got rejected
    *   Permanent: _It’s going to ruin everything._ Most things don’t ruin everything. 
*   Change your explanatory style and enlist the three Ps - Is this personal/pervasive/permanent? Probably not :)
*   Treat yourself the way you would treat a friend.


### Introvert, Extrovert, or Ambivert

Despite what you might think, extroverts are not the best salespeople. Discover what personality type actually sells best and how to cultivate that optimal mentality.



*   Extroverts are more likely to be interested in, get hired in, and get promoted in sales job
*   Personality and effectiveness have 0 correlation
*   A study was done where they measured the introversion and extroversion of a large tech company. The ambiverts had a huge advantage to the personality type.
*   Introversion and extroversion remains stable for most of a person’s life. If you want to change it, try to persuade yourselves in situations that make you mildly uncomfortable in the beginning. Also, try to be a better listener.


#### Persuade Yourself: How to Self-Motivate

Learn what it takes to persuade yourself.



*   The Just 5 More Technique: Just 5 more emails. You end up sending 15 emails. Once you get the momentum, you can keep going
*   Set an Interim Goal: Sometimes it is extremely daunting to set a huge goal.Set interim goals, and then once you’re done, set another goal
*   Make a public commitment
*   Take a break. More effective breaks are outside rather than inside, they are moving rather than stationery, and is with other people rather than solitary
*   Employ deadlines, but cautiously 


#### Using Timing to Become a Better Persuader

We often focus on what we need to accomplish and how to get everything done—but Daniel explains why we also need to focus on the “when” of these decisions.



*   Focussing on the time and the sequence is important. 
*   When you pitch matters
*   You want to go first when:
    *   You are not the default candidate. You are more likely to get a fresh look from your audience
    *   When there are relatively fewer candidates, you get the advantage of the primacy effect. 
    *   When other job candidates are very strong, they’ll start more aggressively looking for flaws in the later ones.
*   You want to go toward the end when:
    *   If you are the default competitor
    *   When they are a large number of competitors
    *   If the criteria of selection are not super clear. Let the other people who go first figure it out for you.
*   When to give bad news
    *   4 out of 5 people prefer to get the bad news first. In general, you are better off starting with the bad news, and going with the good news. The preference is for rising sequences, rather than declining sequences.
*   Schedule tough requests after breaks
    *   When people make decisions, they already have a default decision, which is almost always no. People are more likely to overcome default earlier in the day, and after a break.


#### Beginnings, Middles, and Endings

Different stages of work require us to behave differently. Understanding more about those behavioral differences allows us to perform better.



*   Certain dates are temporal landmarks, they get us to slow down. 
*   In general, the first of the month is better than the middle. Monday is better than Thursday. How something begins has a huge effect on how it carries forward.
*   Avoid persuasion mistakes with a pre-mortem: Think about what all could go wrong. You’d much rather make mistakes in your head than make mistakes in reality.
*   Midpoints and motivation - Sometimes when we get in the middle of something, it drags us down. In teams, something about the midpoint, it galvanizes them and fires them up. When you hit a midpoint, recognize it is a midpoint, use it as an alarm clock, and convince yourself that you’re a little bit behind
*   Endings help us energize and motivate. The age at which people are most likely to run a marathon is 29,39,59, etc. When we get to the end of something, we kick a little harder
*   As a persuader, help people see the end to get them moving.
*   Given a choice, people prefer a rising sequence, than a declining sequence.
*   Encode your endings. How something ends, whether it is a sales transaction or a vacation. How the experience ends paints the entire experience.
*   Pay attention to endings because that’s how people are going to remember the entire experience.
