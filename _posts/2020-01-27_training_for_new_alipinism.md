Can't recommend this [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18342422-training-for-the-new-alpinism) enough for an aspiring mountaineer.

# Excerpt

-   Failure on alpines happen when ambition outstrips ability
    
-   Controlling the things that you can control gave me greater freedom to address the things that you could not control.
    
-   You have to carry your own engine, so increase your power to weight ratio
    
-   To make yourself as indestructible as possible. In short: resilience
    
-   The ideal engine could go forever, produce explosive force on demand, and operate at 50-60% of peak force for long without overheating.
    
-   Train harder, train better, climb more
  

#### Methodology of Endurance Training

-   What is above knows what is below, what is below does not know what is above. Even when one is below, one can no longer see, but one knows.
    
-   The option to drop out mid-way doesn’t exist for a climber, and the descent is often as challenging as the ascent
    
-   “Fatigue makes cowards of all of us”
    
-   On big routes in big mountains, speed equals safety
    
-   This requires technical ability and endurance to support it
    
-   The two types of training
    

-   The general conditioning that readies you for event-specific training
    
-   The training that prepares you for a specific way for the event itself
    

-   Iceberg illusion
    

-   The end process of a preparation process measured in years
    

-   Aerobic
    

-   Depends on oxygen for the chemical reactions
    

-   Anaerobic
    

-   Energy can be produced in the absence of oxygen as well
    

-   Humans have retained the capacity of anaerobic energy generation as well
    
-   A fit human can run down most animals in a contest of endurance. Endurance energy is produced aerobically
    
-   Endurance: The ability to resist fatigue, in both a muscular and cardiovascular sense
    
-   Types of reactions
    

-   Lipolysis : Metabolism of fats
    
-   Glycolysis: Metabolism of sugars
    

-   Lazy enzymes are different than athlete enzymes. Athlete enzymes get produced as a result of the body realizing, over bouts of activity, that they are needed. Such enzymes in a lazy person would get eliminated, or be rid by the body, as they are just taking space
    
-   Your training should be stressful enough to stimulate change, not stressful to damage your body
    
-   Training is not the work that you do, it is the value and cost of your body’s response to that work
    

The Guiding Principles: Continuity, Gradualness, and Modulation

-   Modulation occurs in three to six weeks cycles
    
-   By specificity, we mean that the most effective training will be specific to movements done, and at a similar speed and intensity.
    
-   Give priority to weight bearing exercises. Eg: Running and hiking uphill > swimming
    
-   By controlling the intensity of the training, you control which type of muscle fiber gets trained and which energy pathways get used
    

#### Heart Rate Zones

-   Recovery zone: HR < 50-55% of max
    

-   This very low intensity training is used for recovery from other strenuous efforts. They are supposed to speed your recovery.
    
-   This produce aerobic hormones that promote the rebuilding of muscles that were damaged
    

-   Basic endurance: 55-75% of max HR
    

-   Conversational pace
    
-   Upper end is the Aerobic threshold
    
-   Aerobic threshold power output is the single most important measure of a person’s aerobic system
    
-   This is the most important zone in mountain climbing. You will spend the majority of your time in this zone
    

#### The Physiology of Endurance Training

-   “I would say that the need to climb comes from that tough, lonely place of searching for your dignity. You know, that place—where we actually choose to confront our own weaknesses and fears, where we rebel against the terror of death—is really about dignity. That’s why alpinism is not just the act of ascending a mountain, but also inwardly of ascending above yourself.”
    
-   “According to one popular theory of evolutionary biology, early hominids in equatorial latitudes exploited their aerobic endurance and lack of hair (which allowed them to avoid the overheating fate of their prey) to run their next meal to the point of exhaustion. This subsequently helped them rise to the top of the food chain despite their physical weakness.”
    
-   Maximize your aerobic base
    

-   VO2 max: Amount of oxygen your body can process and sustain for several minutes
    
-   The % of that maximum that you can sustain for a very long time
    
-   “Your VO2 max shows what your maximum potential is, while the fractional utilization, or anaerobic threshold, is the percentage of that maximum you are capable of maintaining for long durations (over thirty minutes.)”
    

#### Summary

-   Improve the ultimate aerobic power of the ST muscle fibers. This is done by a high volume of training done at low intensity at or below your aerobic threshold. This is what increases a person’s aerobic qualities and establishes a metabolic base of support for improving the lactate shuttle process. This improvement of the aerobic threshold (AeT) manifests as an increase of the pace that is sustainable at lower intensities for hours on end. Over years of correct training this increase can be profound. It is what allows elite male marathoners to run twenty-six consecutive sub-five-minute miles.
    
-   Progressively increase the relative volume of training (time or distance) spent at moderate intensities to accomplish several goals: Improve the lactate shuttle effectiveness, increase the power of the ST fibers, and improve the aerobic capacities of the FT fibers needed to produce higher power levels. These will jointly have the effect of improving your pace at the anaerobic threshold.
    
-   Having number one is essential in order to maximize the improvement in number two. In other words: The improved shuttling capabilities brought about by the higher aerobic threshold and increased aerobic power of the ST fibers is[…]”

#### The Theory of Strength Training

-   “If you don’t have the strength to pull a single move, there is nothing to endure”
    
-   2 ways in which a muscle can increase strength
    

-   Hypertrophy: Increase in the size and elements within the muscle that allow it to contract with more force
