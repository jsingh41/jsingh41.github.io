> Negotiation is the art of letting the other side have your way


## MasterClass


### The Art of Negotiation


#### Tactical Empathy

While many believe that negotiation is a battle, Chris sees successful negotiation as a collaboration rooted in empathy.



*   Empathy is becoming completely aware of the other side’s perspective. How do they see it, how do they feel. It’s not agreeing, or compassion, or sympathy,  it’s just awareness.
*   You have to understand what their rules are, and you have to respect those. You don’t necessarily have to adopt those rules. 
*   Don’t engage in predictable dialogue. 


#### Mirroring

Mirroring is one of the most simple yet effective techniques in any negotiator’s repertoire. Through simple repetition, Chris demonstrates how you can gather vital information in a negotiation and put your counterpart at ease.



*   Common misconception: You have to lay your argument, give your points.
*   _Negotiation is the art of letting the other side have your way_
*   Mirroring gets them talking, and gets them to present your deal thinking it was their idea.
*   Repeat the last three words - gets them to talk more about what is going on.
*   Become the most interesting person in the room - by being interested.


#### Labeling

Learn how you can use labels—verbal observations of feelings—to neutralize negative emotions in a negotiation or reinforce positive ones to create a better deal.



*   Labeling is verbalising observations of feelings - to neutralize negative emotions in a negotiation or reinforce positive ones to create a better deal.
*   You’ve got a great gut instinct. Becoming aware of what your gut instinct is picking up.
*   First few words of a label - it seems like, it sounds like, it feels like.
*   How not to label
    *   What I’m hearing is ..
        *   Don’t drop the “I”, Don’t make it about yourself.
        *   A good label lets it sink in.
*   Label more than once.
*   Labeling negatives diffuses it every time.
*   Reinforce positive emotions
    *   Labeling a negative deactivates a negative.
    *   Labeling a positive reinforces it.
    *   Say to the customer service: I appreciate you being generous with your time
*   Mirroring and labels go hand in hand.


#### Mastering Delivery

The way you say something during a negotiation is as important as the words you choose. Chris explores how you can use tone and inflection to your advantage and shares his top tips for online communication.



*   Use your voice. Let your voice convey the following
    *   Deference
    *   Genuine curiosity
    *   Collaboration
*   Don’t let your tone of voice convey that you think the other person is stupid, or a robot.
*   Hit the mirror neurons.
*   Mirror neurons - Use the FM DJ voice.
    *   Default voice for hostage negotiation.
    *   It calms or slows the other side down, tamps down your emotion.
    *   When you want someone to calm down, hit them with the late night FM DJ voice. Trigger their neurons in a positive way.
    *   Don’t let yourself be held hostage by wondering whether or not they like you.
    *   Smile, make them feel like you are worthy of collaboration.
*   3 tones of voice, combined with 2 inflections
    *   Assertive voice
        *   Mostly the natural voice for people who are blunt, direct and honest.
        *   But sometimes it can feel like you’re getting punched in the nose.
        *   Always counterproductive.
        *   Anger is always bad for long term relationships.
        *   Ditch the assertive voice.
    *   Playful/smiling voice
        *   Higher pitch, “I want to work with you on this, I don’t want to back you in a corner”.
        *   You should use this voice about 80% of the time.
    *   Analyst voice
        *   Downward-deflecting voice.
        *   Slow, soothing tone.
        *   Use it for non-negotiable, immutable things.
        *   This voice lacks warmth.
*   FM DJ voice doesn’t lack warmth
    *   Use it no more than 20% of the time.
    *   Use it when the other side is upset.
*   Would you play chess via email? Would you put all 7 moves in an email?
    *   Make one good move in each communication
    *   Tone of email should be more positive than what it feels verbally


#### Body Language and Speech Patterns

How people behave and how they say things can be much more insightful in a negotiation than what they say. This lesson is about looking beyond the surface and distinguishing truth from fiction.



*   You detect if a person is telling a lie by first observing how they tell the truth.
*   First objective is to soak up as much information as possible.
*   The 7/38/55 rule:
    *   The three components of a communication are: content, tonality, body language.
    *   The tone of voice is 5x more important than the words that are said.
    *   Body language and tone of voice is the most reliable when it is out of line with the words being spoken, and then point something out with a label.
        *   “I heard you say yes, but there’s something in your tone of voice that says you’re not entirely happy with the deal”
*   People who are ridiculously  unguarded in their body language are the ones who you are not directly talking to. They are going to be insanely honest in their reactions, who are not the primary point of attention.
*   You have one way of telling the truth, and a bunch of different ways to lie.
*   Once you know that a person is lying or is thinking of lying, what do you do with that information?
    *   The more effort they go to convince you to tell the truth, the more likely that they’re lying. 
*   How to respond to a lie:
    *   Label : “I heard you saying you’re happy with the deal, but seems like there’s more than meets the eye”
    *   The tone of voice should be curious, interested, collaborative. It should not be accusatory
*   When someone is lying to you, it is also because they don’t trust you with the truth
    *   Use the late night FM DJ voice. Continue to show them that you’re worthy of them being unguarded, and they’ll drop the guard.


#### Creating the Illusion of Control

Who has more control in a negotiation: the person who’s talking or the person who’s listening? Chris lets you in on the secret to gaining the upper hand in a negotiation and explains how you can shift the power dynamic to your advantage.



*   The secret to gaining the upper hand in a negotiation is to give the other side the illusion of control.
*   Calibrated question, or an open ended question, is meant to give the illusion of control.
    *   Calibrate with “what” and “how”. People love to be asked “what to do”, people love to be asked “how to do something”.
    *   Why as a question triggers defensiveness. “Why did you break the glass” as a kid points out that you did something wrong.
    *   Asking why they want something creates defensiveness.
    *   Instead of “why do you need delivery in three weeks”, say “what makes it necessary to get it delivered in three weeks”, it takes the accusation out of it.
        *   Say it with deference.
    *   Ask questions to force empathy.
        *   Forced empathy : “How am I supposed to do that?”
        *   Helps shape empathy, triggers slow in-depth thinking.
    *   Use calibrated questions to shape thinking.
        *   Ask three questions, worded differently.
            *   How am I supposed to do that?
            *   What happens if I do that?
            *   How do I overcome the challenges that I have here?
        *   They will appreciate the fact that you help them think it through, and will give you better answers.
    *   Avoid triggering reciprocity:
        *   If we ask, we tend to owe.
        *   You don’t want to trigger reciprocity inadvertently. “What’s your name” - I should be willing to give an exchange.
        *   “How” is a good question that avoids triggering. How do I know that..
    *   Ask legitimate questions
        *   How are we going to move forward if we make this deal?
        *   How do I know that you’re not just looking for a free consultant


#### The Accusations Audit

There are often a lot of feelings in the room when a negotiation starts. Chris teaches you how to use an accusations audit as a means of identifying these feelings and turning negatives into positives.



*   An accusations audit is taking a step back and taking an inventory and doing an audit of all the negative, names, accusations, slanderous things that the other side might be thinking about you, either based on their experience or from a past life. All the things that you’d say “I don’t want you to feel”.
*   Make a list and go after them, quickly and fearlessly
*   Unexpressed negative emotions never die. They fester like an infection, and they become cancerous. Get them out in the front and trigger the working collaborative relationship from the beginning.
*   The elephant in the room doesn’t go away by pretending it’s not there. It is diminished when you address it.
*   If you’ve had long relationships, go straight for the labels
*   Eg: For a late checkout “I’m getting ready to make your day ridiculously difficult”
*   Be exhaustive and fearless. Go after as many bad things as possible, to the point where the other party says “Hey don’t be too hard on yourself”
*   Be willing to test drive it. Pick some low stakes conversation where if it goes down, no harm done.


#### The Value of No

Most people think the most important word in a negotiation is “yes.” In fact, the opposite is true. Chris tells you why “no” can be the pivotal word that gets you to your desired outcome.



*   You can get a lot more information, when you make people feel like, not only is it okay to say no, but that no is a really good answer.
*   A counterfeit yes is an elongated yes “Yeahhhh” or “Suuuure”.
*   A true yes is usually a short affirmative “Yes”
*   Sometimes a no is a yes waiting in hiding.
*   A properly phased no oriented question is worthy of five yeses. People feel safe and protected when they say no.
*   Instead of “Is this a good idea”, ask “Is this a ridiculous idea”.
*   “Are you against committing to X”, “Would it be ridiculous to”.
*   A confirmation yes without a how will die.


#### Bending Reality

A negotiation can succeed or fail depending on how you frame your case. Chris walks you through the subtle art of perspective and how to understand a counterpart’s key emotional drivers in order to make a compelling case.



*   Loss aversion, or fear of loss changes people’s perspective so much that it bends their reality.
*   Figure out what they are going to lose if they don’t/do make the deal.
*   Fear of loss is what keeps people up at night, not the gains that people make.
*   Appeal to their sense of fairness
    *   Fair comes up in every negotiation. People use it to manipulate other people, when they’re backed against the corner
    *   People will intentionally destroy deals and walk away with nothing if they feel that the process was unfair. 
    *   People will take a less than optimal deal if they feel that they were treated fairly
*   If the other side thinks they’ve been treated unfairly, ask them “I’m happy to be shown how I was unfair”.
*   It is my intention to treat you fairly. If at any point of time it feels like things are unfair, you let me know.
*   Deadlines are designed to get progress started. It is put in by one party to kickstart the progress. Once some progress is shown, the deadlines usually go away.
*   The last impression:
    *   When you’re feeling attacked, the things that you really want to say, the words that you think will feel it’ll win, are probably wrong.
    *   If your last word is a cheap shot, when we’re afraid to not have control or the last negative word. 
    *   The last impression is a lasting impression.
    *   Make the last point you made to be inarguably positive and collaborative, and it will seed the next interaction in a positive way.


#### Bargaining

Hard bargaining doesn’t have to mean taking a sledgehammer approach. Chris teaches you how to bargain with skill, diplomacy, and tact.



*   The Ackerman System
    *   Set a target.
    *   Come in at 65% of the price.
    *   Plan on making three raises.
        *   First raise: 20%
        *   Next: 10%
        *   Next: 5%
    *   Throw out an odd number and also throw in some non-monetary object that you know the other side doesn’t want, and they’ve really tapped you out.
    *   Decreasing increments makes the other team feel that you’re winning.
    *   How to phrase:
        *   “Look..I’ll give you the price, but you’re going to like it. I’m scared to give you the price because it is going to make you really angry” 
            *   You’re asking for permission to give them the price
        *   “Naah, it’s going to make you angry, I’m afraid to give you this number”. At this point, they’ll almost beg you to give this number. 
        *   You differentially give them the number, 65%
        *   Next move is going to be tactical empathy
            *   “I’m so sorry,  it’s horrible, and I can see that I’ve offended you. You’re asking for a reasonable price and I’m giving you this”
        *   You can’t budge off and raise the stakes unless they’ve stepped off from their previous number
        *   Be grateful, be thankful. I’d like to give you another number, I’ve worked really hard for this, I gotta check for my finances. Throw the $85.
        *   Now they’re feeling like they’re making progress
        *   Always increase by decreasing increments
    *   Make a show that you’re working really hard.
    *   You need to make them feel a sense of accomplishment.
    *   Know where the other party is coming from, that’s information that is helpful.
    *   If someone is pushing you to go first, you can pivot to non-monetary terms.
        *   Say “I’ll be happy to give you a deal, but let’s figure out what it means for you to have a great deal”.
    *   What kind of follow up service do they want? 
    *   The price might break the deal but the deal is made on the terms, so ask them about what kind of follow up service they would want.
    *   Setting a range is a great way to not exactly name the price.
        *   They’re not going to go for the middle range. They’re going to pick the end that favors them.
    *   Range is dictated by two things: What’s going on in the market, and what you’re going to pay.
    *   Anchor emotions, not dollars.
        *   An anchor is a price that you throw out which is quite some distance from where you want to land.
